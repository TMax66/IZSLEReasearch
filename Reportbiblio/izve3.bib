Abstract = {{From 2006 to date, serious epidemic waves of a Blue tongue virus
   serotype 8 (BTV-8) have occurred in Central-Northern
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   Europe. In 2007, more than 12,000 outbreaks were recorded in Belgium,
   the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Germany. Every year, Italy,
   particularly the Veneto Region, imports several hundred thousands cattle
   for the restocking of feed-lots from these countries. In particular, in
   2007 the Veneto Region imported about 420,000 cattle from France. From
   26 October 2007 to 26 February 2008, 33 of these animals, introduced to
   15 different meat-cattle holdings in the Region, were found to be
   seropositive to BTV-8 (26 of these bovines were also PCR positive).
   This new epidemiological situation has focussed the attention on
   strengthening the BT surveillance system in this Region. in order to
   early detect any introduction of BTV-8 and put proper sanitary measures
   into place to limit the possible spread of infection. In order to
   identify the areas exposed to a higher risk of BT introduction, an
   Explorative Spatial Data Analysis was carried out using an MCM (Multiple
   Criteria Method) system taking into consideration BT risk factors such
   as importation of cattle from areas at risk where active BTV circulation
   was detected, and areas with a high density of dairy and beef cattle.
   The analysis also included the presence of vectors.
   Three areas identified at higher risk of BT introduction were subjected
   to additional targeted surveillance. On 13(th) march, during these
   additional controls, the first. Italian outbreak of BTV-8 has been
   detected in Isola della Scala municipality (Verona Province). Monitoring
   activity on tank milk had permitted to reveal the presence of nine
   positive samples of which only four were confirmed by the National
   Reference Centre. These findings have led the Authorities to establish a
   restriction zone which has been updated based on the epidemiological
   situation and to implement a vaccination campaign in susceptible animals
   of Verona and Mantoya Provinces.}},

Abstract = {{Influenza A viruses that infect poultry can be divided into two groups.
   Very virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),
   with flock mortality as high as 100\%. These viruses have been
   restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5 and H7 viruses
   cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a milder, primarily respiratory,
   disease (LPAI), unless exacerbated. Until recently, HPAI viruses were
   rarely isolated from wild birds, but for LPAI viruses extremely high
   isolation rates have been recorded in surveillance studies. Influenza
   viruses may infect all types of domestic or captive birds in all areas
   of the world. The frequency with which primary infections occur in any
   type of bird usually depends on the degree of contact there is with
   feral birds. Secondary spread is typically associated with human
   involvement, either by birds or bird product movement or by transferring
   infective faeces from infected to susceptible birds, but potentially
   wild birds can be involved. In recent years the frequency of HPAI
   outbreaks appears to have increased and there have been particularly
   costly outbreaks of HPAI in densely populated poultry areas in Italy,
   The Netherlands and Canada. In each outbreak millions of birds were
   slaughtered to bring the outbreaks under control. Since the 1990s, AI
   infections due to two subtypes have been widespread in poultry across a
   large area of the World. LPAI H9N2 appears to have spread across the
   whole of Asia in that time and has become endemic in poultry in many of
   the affected countries. However, these outbreaks have been overshadowed
   by the H5N1 HPAI virus, initially isolated in China that has now spread
   in poultry and/or wild birds throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa,
   resulting in the death or culling of hundreds of millions of poultry and
   posing a significant zoonosis threat. To date control methods seem to
   have been unsuccessful on the larger scale and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks
   continue to be reported.}},

Abstract = {{Since early 2007, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has experienced
   several highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks in the
   falconry and poultry sectors. The public health threat associated with
   peculiar husbandry systems, requiring close contact between humans and

   analyses of H5N1 viruses isolated in the KSA in 2007 in distinct

   it appears that two separate introductions into the different sectors
   occurred. The identification of specific amino acid mutations, which are
   described as genetic signatures of human influenza A viruses or known to

Abstract = {{Aims: To investigate the presence of enteric viruses {[}hepatitis A
   (HAV) and norovirus (NoV)] in shellfish harvested from the deltaic area
   of the Po river in relation to environmental factors.
   Methods and Results: Fortnightly sampling of shellfish was carried out
   in two lagoon areas (category B production areas) and one sea area
   (category A). Environmental parameters in the lagoon and hydrometric
   level of the tributary river were monitored throughout the sampling
   period. Samples (n = 120) were analysed for bacterial (E. coli and
   Salmonella) and viral (HAV and NoV) contamination; samples from category
   B areas were analysed before and after purification treatment. All the
   samples were negative for HAV whereas 10 samples (8.3\%), all harvested
   in the lagoon areas, were positive for NoV. Sequencing identified the
   strains as genotypes II.4 and II.b. None of the samples was found to be
   contaminated after depuration.
   Conclusions: The monitoring showed a low frequency of NoV presence;
   viral contamination, detected exclusively in shellfish collected from
   the deltaic area (category B), could be influenced by the flow of the
   tributary river.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The data collected are useful for
   the design of targeted prevention strategies and for the modulation of
   control plans after meteorological events.}},

Abstract = {{Rabbit diarrhoea caused by toxigenic Clostridium spiroforme is
   responsible for significant losses in commercial rabbitries but the
   accurate identification of this micro-organism is difficult due to the
   absence of both a commercial biochemical panel and biomolecular methods.
   The aim of this study was therefore to develop PCR protocols for
   specific detection of C. spiroforme and its binary toxin encoding genes.
   The C. spiroforme specie-specific primers were designed based on its 16S
   rDNA published sequences and the specificity of these primers was tested
   with DNA extracted from closely related Clostridium species. The
   sa/bs\_F and sa/bs\_R C. spiroforme binary toxin specific primers were
   designed to be complementary, respectively, to a sequence of 21 bases on
   the 3' and of sas gene and on the 5' of the sbs gene. The detection
   limits of in house developed PCR protocols were 25 CFU/ml of bacterial
   suspension and 1.38 x 10(4) CFU/g of caecal content for specie-specific
   primers and 80 CFU/ml of bacterial suspension and 2.8 x 10(4) CFU/g of
   caecal content in case of sa/bs primers. These results indicated that
   the described PCR assays enable specific identification of C. spiroforme
   and its binary toxin genes and can therefore be considered a rapid,
   reliable tool for the diagnosis of C. spiroforme-related enterotoxaemia.

Abstract = {{Although the use of vaccines against avian influenza viruses in birds
   has been discouraged over the years, the unprecedented occurrence of
   outbreaks caused by avian influenza (AI) viruses in recent times has
   required review of this policy. A variety of products are now available
   on the market, ranging from inactivated conventional to live recombinant
   products. The general consensus on the use of vaccination is that if
   complying to GMP standards and properly administered, birds will be more
   resistant to field challenge and will exhibit reduced shedding levels in
   case of infection. However, viral circulation may still occur in a
   clinically healthy vaccinated population. This may result in an endemic
   situation and in the emergence of antigenic variants. In order to limit
   these risks, monitoring programmes enabling the detection of field
   exposure in vaccinated populations are recommended by international
   organisations and are essential to allow the continuation of
   international trade. Adequate management of a vaccination campaign,
   including monitoring, improved biosecurity and restriction is essential
   for the success of any control program for AI. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{H9N2 avian influenza A viruses are endemic in poultry of many Eurasian
   countries and have caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998.
   To evaluate the potential threat of H9N2 viruses to humans, we
   investigated the replication and transmission efficiency of H9N2 viruses
   in the ferret model. Five wild-type (WT) H9N2 viruses, isolated from
   different avian species from 1988 through 2003, were tested in vivo and
   found to replicate in ferrets. However these viruses achieved mild peak
   viral titers in nasal washes when compared to those observed with a
   human H3N2 virus. Two of these H9N2 viruses transmitted to direct
   contact ferrets, however no aerosol transmission was detected in the
   virus displaying the most efficient direct contact transmission. A
   leucine (Leu) residue at amino acid position 226 in the hemagglutinin (
   HA) receptor-binding site (RBS), responsible for human virus-like
   receptor specificity, was found to be important for the transmission of
   the H9N2 viruses in ferrets. In addition, an H9N2 avian-human
   reassortant virus, which contains the surface glycoprotein genes from an
   H9N2 virus and the six internal genes of a human H3N2 virus, showed
   enhanced replication and efficient transmission to direct contacts.
   Although no aerosol transmission was observed, the virus replicated in
   multiple respiratory tissues and induced clinical signs similar to those
   observed with the parental human H3N2 virus. Our results suggest that
   the establishment and prevalence of H9N2 viruses in poultry pose a
   significant threat for humans.}},

Abstract = {{The potential existence of a wild bird reservoir for highly pathogenic
   avian influenza (HPAI) has been recently questioned by the spread and
   the persisting circulation of H5N1 HPAI viruses, responsible for
   concurrent outbreaks in migratory and domestic birds over Asia, Europe,
   and Africa. During a large-scale surveillance programme over Eastern
   Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we detected avian influenza viruses
   of H5N2 subtype with a highly pathogenic (HP) viral genotype in healthy
   birds of two wild waterfowl species sampled in Nigeria. We monitored the
   survival and regional movements of one of the infected birds through
   satellite telemetry, providing a rare evidence of a non-lethal natural
   infection by an HP viral genotype in wild birds. Phylogenetic analysis
   of the H5N2 viruses revealed close genetic relationships with H5 viruses
   of low pathogenicity circulating in Eurasian wild and domestic ducks. In
   addition, genetic analysis did not reveal known gallinaceous poultry
   adaptive mutations, suggesting that the emergence of HP strains could
   have taken place in either wild or domestic ducks or in non-gallinaceous
   species. The presence of coexisting but genetically distinguishable
   avian influenza viruses with an HP viral genotype in two cohabiting
   species of wild waterfowl, with evidence of non-lethal infection at
   least in one species and without evidence of prior extensive circulation
   of the virus in domestic poultry, suggest that some strains with a
   potential high pathogenicity for poultry could be maintained in a
   community of wild waterfowl.}},

   lesions) was examined clinically, and samples were taken for the
   detection of Malassezia and L. infantum using various diagnostic
   methods. Malassezia was cultured from skin samples from 101 (53.7\%)
   dogs and classified biochemically and molecularly as M. pachydermatis. A
   significantly higher mean population size of M. pachydermatis was
   cultured from the skin of L+ dogs compared with L- dogs. For M.
   pachydermatis, most phospolipase-producing cultures and the highest
   phospholipase activity were recorded for L- dogs with lesions and L+
   dogs without lesions. The results showed that M. pachydermatis was a
   common commensal on dogs with or without L. infantum infection and
   established that L. infantum infection in dogs without skin lesions was
   associated with increased growth of M. pachydermatis and production of

Abstract = {{Several countries within the European Union (EU) have successfully
   eradicated Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), while others (e.g.
   Germany) are making efforts to achieve IBR-free status. EU member states
   IBR eradication programmes must meet Community legislation requirements
   that ban breeding farms from purchasing positive animals, from using
   whole-virus IBR vaccines, and from inseminating cows with semen from
   positive bulls. A follow-up study from 2002 to 2005 was carried out in
   the province of Trento (Italy), where a compulsory programme for IBR
   eradication was started in 1998. IBR outbreaks (identified on the basis
   of seroconversion of sentinel animals) were concentrated in larger
   positive herds. A higher incidence was recorded between 2003 and 2004.
   An association between markedly high temperatures in the summer of 2003
   and virus reactivation has been suggested but is yet to be confirmed.
   The practice of driving cattle to common alpine pastures for the summer
   season did not play a significant epidemiological role in IBR
   transmission. Premising that only seronegative animals are allowed to
   enter dairy farms, animal movement increases the infection risk to a
   moderate extent. The long-term persistence of IBR antibodies was more
   pronounced in animals positive for antibodies to the glycoprotein E
   (gE). Scattered seroconversions, occurring mostly in positive herds,
   require careful interpretation in order to avoid overestimating the
   incidence of the infection at herd level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objectives: Plasmids belonging to incompatibility group I1 (IncI1) are
   widespread in Enterobacteriaceae and are characterized by the presence
   of a cluster of genes encoding the type IV pili, contributing to the
   virulence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli. Recently, IncI1 plasmids
   were identified in E. coli and Salmonella strains of animal origin as
   responsible for the dissemination of beta-lactamase genes. Plasmid
   multilocus sequence typing (pMLST) was developed to discern naturally
   occurring IncI1 plasmids in homogeneous groups according to their allele
   assortment.
   Methods: pMLST was developed by selecting multiple target genes on the
   available complete IncI1 plasmid DNA sequences. Sixteen plasmids, all
   assigned to the IncI1 group by the PCR-based replicon typing method,
   were included in this study. They were analysed for beta-lactamase genes
   and typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and pMLST.
   Results: Sixteen plasmids identified in E. coli and Salmonella isolated
   from animals and humans in different countries carried bla(CMY-2),
   bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-1), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(TEM-52), bla(SHV-12) or
   bla(TEM-1) beta-lactamase genes. These plasmids were classified by RFLP
   in nine different groups corresponding to the nine sequence types
   determined by pMLST.
   Conclusions: The pMLST method was suitable for rapid and easy subtyping
   of IncI1 plasmids. This study demonstrates that the pMLST method can
   contribute to the epidemiological description of circulation of specific
   resistance plasmids among beta-lactamase producers isolated from animals
   and humans.}},

Abstract = {{Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME) caused by Ehrlichia canis is the

   Preventing tick bites is a priority to reduce the risk of TBDs and it
   was the aim of the present study to evaluate the efficacy of a
   combination of imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% (ImPer) (Advantix
   (R); Bayer AG, Germany) in a spot-on formulation to control CME under
   field conditions. On January-March 2005, 845 dogs from two kennels in
   southern Italy (kennels of Bari (KB)- and Ginosa (KG)), with a history
   of tick infestation were initially tested by serology and PCR assay for
   E. canis infection. Data on Leishmania infantum infection were also
   available from a previous study carried out on the same dog population.
   One hundred twenty-six dogs (14.9\%) presented anti-E. canis antibodies
   with a relative prevalence of 15.6\% (n = 65 dogs in KB) and 14.2\% (n =
   61 dogs in KG). Five hundred thirty-five animals found negative both for
   E. canis and L infantum infections were enrolled in three groups (Group
   A-treated with ImPer once a month; Group B-treated every 2 weeks; and
   Group C-untreated control animals) and monitored for E. canis infection
   by serology and PCR in November 2005 (first follow-up) and in March 2006
   (second follow-up). The E. canis infection was serologically revealed,
   at the first and/or second follow-up, in 26 animals from Group C in KB
   and KG (mean incidence density rate (IDR), 13.24\%) while in none of the
   animals from Group A (KB and KG) and only in one animal from Group B
   (IDR 1.13\%) in KG. The final protection efficacy of ImPer ranged from
   95.57\% to 100\% in Groups B and A. At PCR only 15 dogs from KG were
   positive for Rickettsiales only at the first follow-up and at the
   sequence analysis two (both in Group Q revealed 100\% homology with E.
   canis sequences while 13 with Anaplasma platys. Four out of 13A. platys
   PCR-positive dogs were also seropositive for E. canis at one or both
   follow-ups. ImPer, by virtue of its repellent and acaricidal activity
   against ticks, has been shown to be efficacious to prevent E. canis
   infection in treated dogs living under natural conditions in endemic
   areas. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (Nematoda, Strongylida) in cats and
   associated risk factors have been investigated by classical coprology in
   central (site A) and southern (site B) Italy, i.e. by floatations with
   sugar and zinc sulphate solutions and a Baermann technique. Overall, 227
   individual stool samples (i.e. 162 from site A and 65 from site B) were
   processed and risk factors were related to infection by binary logistic
   multiple-regression models. The presence of A. abstrusus was used as the
   dependent variable and the epidemiological data as independent
   variables. Twenty-eight (17.3\%) and 12 (18.5\%) cats were positive for
   A. abstrusus in sites A and 13, respectively, both using the Baermann
   and flotation with zinc sulphate solution methods. Six and three (from
   site A and B, respectively) of the infected cats were negative for A.
   abstrusus when faeces were processed with sugar solution. Stray and
   free-ranging (P = 0.357), young cats (P = 0.008) and the presence of
   respiratory symptoms (P = 0.000) were risk factors for A. abstrusus
   infection. The results suggest that A. abstrusus is spread in Italy.
   Furthermore, these results possibly include infection in the
   differential diagnosis of feline respiratory diseases and offer a
   correct diagnostic approach by using either a Baermann method or
   flotation with zinc sulphate solution in suspected cases. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Among the different hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of avian influenza (AI)
   viruses, H5, H7, and H9 are of major interest because of the serious
   consequences for the poultry industry and the increasing frequency of
   direct transmission of these viruses to humans. The availability of new
   tools to rapidly detect and subtype the influenza viruses can enable the
   immediate application of measures to prevent the widespread transmission
   of the infection. In this study, a novel one-step real-time reverse
   transcription-PCR (RRT-PCR) was developed to detect simultaneously the
   H5, H7, and H9 subtypes of AI viruses from clinical samples of avian
   origin. The sensitivity of the RRT-PCR assay was determined by using in
   vitro-transcribed RNA and 10-fold serial dilutions of titrated AI
   viruses. High sensitivity levels were obtained, with limits of detection
   ranging from 10(1) to 10(3) RNA copies and from 10(1) 50\% egg
   infectious dose (EID50)/100 mu l to 10(2.74) EID50/100 mu l with
   titrated viruses. Excellent results were achieved in the intra- and
   interassay variability tests. The comparison of the results with those
   obtained from the analysis of 725 avian samples by means of the
   reference method (virus isolation {[}VI]) showed a high level of
   agreement. To date, this is the first real-time PCR protocol available
   for the simultaneous detection of AI viruses belonging to subtypes H5,
   H7, and 119, and the results obtained indicate that this method is
   suitable as a routine laboratory test for the rapid detection and
   differentiation of the three most-important AI virus subtypes in samples
   of avian origin.}},

   large hyperchromatic nuclei and amphophilic cytoplasm. The tumour varied
   greatly in appearance from one field to another within the same tumour.
   Epithelial cells stained positively with antibodies developed against

Abstract = {{Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) incidence has been increased in Italy in
   humans and dogs since the 1990s, with new foci being detected within
   traditional boundaries of endemic transmission but also in northern
   regions previously regarded as non-endemic. To monitor the putative VL
   spreading, surveillance was implemented in northern continental Italy
   comprising: analysis of human cases recorded from 1990 through 2005;
   retrospective literature analysis of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) and
   phlebotomine sandfly records through 2002; prospective investigations in
   dogs from 2003 through 2005 and surveys on sandflies in 2003 and 2004.
   Two-hundred-thirty human cases (11\% of Italian cases) were recorded.
   Their stratification by age and HIV status disclosed a sharp decrease of
   HlV/VL co-infections paralleled by concomitant increase of paediatric
   and HIV-negative adult patients during the study period. Four patients
   had no travel history. Seven leishmaniasis foci were retrospectively
   identified since 1990, whereas prospective investigations in dogs
   disclosed 47 autochthonous clinical cases and 106 autochthonous
   seropositives among 5442 dogs (2.1\%) from 16 foci of six regions.
   Parasites were typed as Leishmania infantum MON-1. Four vector species
   were identified among 1696 Phlebotomus (Larroussius) collected
   specimens. Comparisons with historical data showed that P. perniciosus
   and P. neglectus have increased in density and expanded their geographic
   range in the study area. Northern continental Italy is now focally
   endemic for VL and a moderate risk for human disease does exist,

   LPAI viruses to cause viraemia or on the presence of avian influenza
   viruses in general in the muscles of infected turkeys. The aim of the
   present study was to determine the ability of LPAI and HPAI H7N1 viruses
   to reach muscle tissues following experimental infection and to
   determine the efficacy of vaccination in preventing viraemia and meat
   localization. The potential of infective muscle tissue to act as a
   source of infection for susceptible turkeys by mimicking the practice of
   swill-feeding was also investigated. The HPAI virus was isolated from
   blood and muscle tissues of all unvaccinated turkeys; LPAI could be
   isolated only from blood of one bird and could be detected only by
   reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in muscles. In contrast,
   no viable virus or viral RNA could be detected in muscles of
   vaccinated/challenged turkeys, indicating that viral localization in
   muscle tissue is prevented in vaccinated birds.}},

Abstract = {{Avian influenza (AI) is a listed disease of the World Organisation for
   Animal Health (OIE) that has become a disease of great importance both
   for animal and human health. Until recent times, AI was considered a
   disease of birds with zoonotic implications of limited significance. The
   emergence and spread of the Asian lineage highly pathogenic AI H5N1
   virus has dramatically changed this perspective; not only has it been
   responsible of the death or culling of millions of birds, but this virus
   has also been able to infect a variety of non-avian hosts including
   human beings. The implications of such a panzootic reflect themselves in
   animal health issues, notably in the reduction of a protein source for
   developing countries and in the management of the pandemic potential.
   Retrospective studies have shown that avian progenitors play an
   important role in the generation of pandemic viruses for humans, and
   therefore these infections in the avian reservoir should be subjected to
   control measures aiming at eradication of the Asian H5N1 virus from all
   sectors rather than just eliminating or reducing the impact of the
   disease in poultry. Collection and analysis of information in a
   transparent environment and close collaboration between the medical and
   veterinary scientific community are crucial to support the global AI
   crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Recent outbreaks of avian influenza (AI) occurring in Europe, in the
   Americas, in Asia and in Africa have provided field evidence of how
   challenging the control of this infection can be, particularly in
   densely populated poultry areas or in areas where free-range rural
   village poultry and backyard flocks are present. In these areas,
   laboratory testing is mainly applied to trace viral circulation in a
   given area or in a susceptible population to implement an early warning
   system, rather than to diagnose the presence of the virus in a diseased
   flock or animal. This implies the use of rapid, sensitive and possibly
   cost-effective laboratory tests adaptable to very high throughputs. As a
   consequence, new diagnostic approaches and technologies have been
   increasingly developed and applied. Molecular biology and biotechnology
   are providing important and precious contributions to the field of AI
   diagnosis, making extremely rapid, specific and sensitive techniques
   available. However, the use of some of these technologies is still
   limited, due to their costs and to the requirement of advanced technical
   and scientific expertise. Therefore, more conventional and
   well-established techniques, should not be abandoned but rather
   reconsidered and improved or modified.}},

Abstract = {{Vaccination against avian influenza (AI) infections caused by viruses of
   the H5 and H7 subtypes has been used in several occasions in recent
   years with the general objective of controlling and in some cases
   eradicating the disease. To contain AI infections effectively,
   vaccination should only be used as part of a comprehensive control
   strategy that also includes biosecurity, quarantine, surveillance,
   education, and elimination of infected and at-risk poultry. Although
   properly used, potent AI vaccines can prevent disease and death,
   increase resistance to infection, reduce virus replication and shedding,
   and reduce viral transmission, they cannot completely prevent AI virus
   replication. A wide variety of vaccines against AI has been developed
   and tested in experimental conditions, but only inactivated whole AI
   virus vaccines and recombinant H5-AI vaccines have been licensed and
   widely used in various countries. AI vaccination programmes should be
   adapted to local conditions to guarantee efficacy and sustainability. In
   particular, vaccination programmes should be modulated in diverse
   situations according to the virus strain involved, the characteristics
   of the poultry producing sector, the capacity of the veterinary
   infrastructure, and the availability of adequate resources. Based on the
   eco-epidemiological situation in the affected region/area/compartment
   and the assessment of the risk of AI introduction, different vaccination
   strategies could be implemented to control AI: (i) routine vaccination
   performed in endemic areas; (ii) emergency vaccination in the face of an
   epidemic; and (iii) preventative vaccination carried out whenever a high

Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes has been detected in fresh as well as dry and
   semidry fermented sausages, rendering preparation and consumption of
   these products as a potential risk to human health. The aims of this
   study were (1) to evaluate the L. monocytogenes prevalence in 288 fresh
   and 237 fermented sausages produced in northern Italy; (2) to quantify
   the average pathogen Most Probable Number (MPN) per g of sausage; (3) to
   evaluate the sausage strain genetic diversity by automated PvuII
   ribotyping; and (4) to predict the pathogenicity lineage of these
   isolates determining their DuPont Identification Library Codes (DUP-IDs)
   by EcoRI ribotyping.
   The overall prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the sampled sausages was
   28.2\%. The percentage of L. monocytogenes positive fresh sausages was
   significantly higher than that of fermented sausages (i.e. 38.9 vs
   15.2\%), which had a pathogen load always lower than 10 MPN/g. In
   contrast, 16.1\% of fresh sausages were contaminated by 10 to 100 MPN/g
   and 20.5\% had more than 100 MPN/g.
   PvuII successfully discriminated sausage isolates with a Simpson's
   numerical index of discrimination of 0.637. A total of 12 and 9
   different PvuII ribogroups were identified among 47 fresh and 24
   fermented randomly selected sausage strains, respectively. Six of those
   ribogroups were shared between strains contaminating both kinds of
   sausages. According to the evaluation of the strain DUP-IDs, the
   majority of the isolates investigated in this study were part of the
   type II L. monocytogenes pathogenicity lineage, but type I lineage
   strains were identified among fermented sausage isolates.
   In conclusion, L. monocytogenes prevalence in Italian sausages was
   estimated to be around 28.2\%. However, 84.2\% of the samples were
   contaminated by less than 100 MPN of L. monocytogenes per g and the
   majority of L. monocytogenes contaminating strains would be classified
   in the type II pathogenicity lineage, including serotypes 1/2a, 1/2c and
   3a. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine seroprevalence of small ruminant lentivirus
   (SRLV) infections among goats in South Tyrol, Italy.
   Design: Prospective serological study.
   Material and methods-animals: 15,980 goats older than 6 months from 1973
   goat herds in South Tyrol were tested by an ELISA for the presence of
   SRLV antibodies. 3148 goats were 6-14 months old (AG 1), 3273 goats were
   15 to 26 months old (AG 2) and 9559 goats were older than 26 months (AG
   3).
   Results: Serological examination revealed that seroprevalence of SRLV
   among goats was 23.6\% and herd prevalence was 38.0\%. Seroprevalence
   was significantly higher (P < 0.002) in AG 3 (25.1\%) than among goats
   in AG 1 (20.6\%) and AG 2 (20.0\%), respectively. Seroprevalence of
   dwarf goats was significantly (P<0.001) lower (4.0\%) when compared with
   the indigenous, mainly prevalent breed ``Passeirer Goat{''} (24.6\%),
   dairy breed (25.6\%) and mixed breed (10.7\%). Seroprevalence was
   significantly higher (P<0.001) among goats born indoors (November-April:
   24.2\%) than in the animals born outdoors (May-October: 20.0\%).
   Seroprevalence among female goats (23.6\%) did not differ significantly
   from male goats (23.7\%).
   Conclusions and clinical relevance: SRLV infections among goats in South
   Tyrol, Italy, are evident. Birth indoors with its consequences (close
   contact, kids suckling by diverse dams or by milk pool) is also a risk
   factor for SRLV infections in South Tyrol. In future more clinical
   outbreaks may occur, and therefore establishing measures to prevent the
   spreading of the disease is necessary. Installing a control or
   eradication programme seroprevalence and genetic and economic aspects
   must be considered. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scrapie and chronic wasting disease are contagious prion diseases
   affecting sheep and cervids, respectively. Studies have indicated that
   horizontal transmission is important in sustaining these epidemics, and
   that environmental contamination plays an important role in this. In the
   perspective of detecting prions in soil samples from the field by more
   direct methods than animal-based bioassays, we have developed a novel
   immuno-based approach that visualises in situ the major component
   (PrPSc) of prions sorbed onto agricultural soil particles. Importantly,
   the protocol needs no extraction of the protein from soil. Using a
   cell-based assay of infectivity, we also report that samples of
   agricultural soil, or quartz sand, acquire prion infectivity after
   exposure to whole brain homogenates from prion-infected mice. Our data
   provide further support to the notion that prion-exposed soils retain
   infectivity, as recently determined in Syrian hamsters intracerebrally
   or orally challanged with contaminated soils. The cell approach of the
   potential infectivity of contaminated soil is faster and cheaper than
   classical animal-based bioassays. Although it suffers from limitations,
   e. g. it can currently test only a few mouse prion strains, the cell
   model can nevertheless be applied in its present form to understand how
   soil composition influences infectivity, and to test prion-inactivating
   procedures.}},

Abstract = {{We estimated between-farm transmission parameters of the highly
   pathogenic avian-influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck the poultry
   industry of northern Italy (including turkeys, layer hens, broilers,
   gamebirds, and waterfowl) from December 1999 through April 2000. We
   estimated the average number of susceptible farms that were infected
   with HPAI virus by each infectious farm during a day (beta) with a
   generalised linear model (GLM). The HPAI's reproductive ratios (R-h; the
   average number of new infected farms (IFs) that were caused by an
   infectious farm) were calculated separately for the regions of Lombardy
   and Veneto, where 382 out of 413 (92.5\%) of IFs were located. In both
   regions, R-h decreased to similar to 1 during the second month of the
   epidemic (showing that its containment had been initiated).
   Subsequently, during the last two months of the epidemic, beta and R-h
   were reduced to 0.04/day and 0.6, respectively, in Veneto and to
   0.07/day and 0.8 in Lombardy. The reduction of the susceptible
   population through strict control measures, including pre-emptive
   slaughter of at-risk poultry flocks, was implemented to a greatest
   extent in Veneto and this might have been associated with a more rapid
   control of the epidemic in this region than in Lombardy. (C) 2007

   were examined after 5 consignments at the final destination, following a
   journey of 2,550 km to the ``San Giorgio{''} abattoir (Palermo, Italy).
   Transport time was of 53.6 +/- 10.9h; lairage duration for bulls of the
   1(st), 3(rd) and 5(th) consignments was of 31h on average ({''}Short
   Lairage{''} group), whereas, for those of the 2(nd) and 4(th)
   consignments, was of 59 and 57h, respectively ({''}Long Lairage{''}
   group). As regards the blood cell counts, data showed a significant
   effect (P<0.001) of the lairage duration on leukocyte and platelet
   counts. No significant effect was observed for erythrocyte count,
   haemoglobin and hematocrit in relation to the lairage duration, although
   the repeated measure analysis of variance showed that, irrespective of
   lairage duration, the hematocrit increased significantly between
   unloading and slaughter. Haematological parameters showed a significant
   (P<0.05) effect of the lairage time only on CK and Cortisol. CK enzyme
   showed an increase in the ``Short Lairage{''} group (33.2\% vs. 14.3\%)
   whereas, Cortisol showed a decrease in the ``Long Lairage{''} group
   (36.3\% vs. 3.8\%). The different lairage duration did not significantly
   (P>0.05) affect the incidence of slight and severe carcass bruises. As
   regards meat quality, lairage duration significantly influenced the pH.
   which was higher (P<0.01) in the muscle of the ``Long Lairage{''} group,
   the luminosity at 24h post mortem which was significantly higher
   (P<0.05) in animals of the ``Short Lairage{''} group, and the red and
   yellow indices which were higher in the ``Long Lairage{''} group. The
   ``Short Lairage{''} group showed a lower (P<0.01) value of cooking loss
   and higher (P<0.01) value of tenderness. Data show that pre-slaughter
   lairage duration after a long transport may influence the blood
   parameters as well as meat quality. On the whole, the increase in
   lairage duration over 36h does not determine any benefit for the
   animal's well-being whereas it can cause a reduction in beef quality.
   For very long transports, it would be better to have an adequate
   organisation of the facilities in order to diminish the pre-slaughter
   lairage duration.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing H5N1 Asian epidemic is currently affecting a number of avian
   species including ducks. These birds are an important part of the
   poultry industry in the affected countries, and it is likely that they
   are acting as a reservoir of infection. Ten Pekin ducks were challenged
   with 100 mu l containing 10(7) 50\% egg infective dose of the highly
   pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) A/Duck/ Vietnam/12/05 (H5N1),
   administered by an intra-nasal and oral route. Clinical symptoms were
   recorded twice a day up to 14 days postinfection (dpi). Clinical signs
   were first noted at 2 dpi, with conjunctivitis and slight depression,
   and progressed over a period of 1-3 days to severe neurologic signs
   consisting of torticollis, incoordination, tremors, and seizures.
   Survival times varied from 3 to 7 dpi. On postmortem examination,
   hemorrhages were observed in the duodenum, ceca, proventriculus,
   ventriculus, trachea, pancreas, and brain. Histologic lesions, as well
   as immunohistochemistry positivity, were recorded in the pancreas and
   brain. In situ hybridization revealed viral antigen associated with
   acinar pancreatic cells, bronchial epithelia] cells, and with cells of
   the central nervous system as well as neurons of the submucosal plexus
   of the duodenum. Our experimental findings agree with those previously
   observed in ducks naturally infected with HPAIV H5N1 viruses, confirming
   the acquired viral neurotropism and pancreatotropism, as previously
   noted in other avian species, as well as in humans.}},

   Gene-deleted vaccines, DIVA strategies (differentiating infected from

Abstract = {{Continuing outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across
   Eurasia and in Africa, caused by a type A influenza virus of the H5N 1
   subtype appear out of control and represent a serious risk for animal
   and public health worldwide. It is known that biosecurity represents the
   first line of defence against AI, although in certain circumstances
   strict hygienic measures appear to be inapplicable for social and
   economic conditions.
   The option of using vaccination against AI viruses of the H5 and H7
   subtypes, has made its way in recent times-primarily as a tool to
   maximise the outcome of a series of control measures in countries that
   are currently infected, but also as a means of reducing the risk of
   introduction in areas at high risk of infection.
   In developing countries vaccination programmes in avian species have
   been recommended recently, however it will require concurrent management
   of local husbandry practices and industry compliance to eradicate the
   disease rather than the establishment of an endemic situation. Other key
   deliverables expected for this control strategy include maintaining a
   major source of food for rural communities and the preservation of the
   commercial viability of the local poultry industry.
   In developed countries vaccination is being used as a means of
   increasing resistance of susceptible animals to reduce the risk of
   introduction from the reservoir host or to reduce secondary spread in
   densely populated poultry areas.
   The recent joint OIE/FAO summits recommended applying vaccination, using
   the differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy
   when there is risk of major spread and depopulation is not feasible or
   desirable. Particularly in developing countries, stamping out of
   infected animals does not seem to be an appropriate means of reducing
   the spread of infection, if food supplies are to be guaranteed and
   economic consequences minimised. Crucial points to the success of a
   vaccination campaign are the implementation of complex territorial
   strategy involving upgraded biosecurity, monitoring vaccine efficacy,
   identification of field exposure and the appropriate management of
   infected flocks, regardless of vaccination status. Granting financial
   support for the compensation of farmers is also a key part of this
   strategy.
   Poultry veterinarians working for the industry or for the public sector
   represent the first line of defence against the pandemic threat and for
   the prevention and control of this infection in poultry and in wild
   birds. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   were detected and isolated in both Eurasian and Afro-tropical bird
   species, indicating that low pathogenic viruses were circulating in

Abstract = {{Since 1999, Italy has been challenged by several epidemics of Notifiable
   Avian Influenza (NAI) of the H5 and H7 subtypes, occurring in the
   densely populated poultry areas of northern part of the country.
   Vaccination with a conventional vaccine containing a seed strain with a
   different neuraminidase subtype to the field virus was used to
   complement biosecurity and restriction measures as part of an overall
   eradication strategy. This vaccination technique, known as the
   ``DIVA-Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals{''} system,
   enabled, the identification of field exposed flocks and ultimately the
   eradication of H7N1, H7N3 and H5N2 infections. A bivalent H5/H7
   prophylactic vaccination programme of defined poultry populations was
   introduced subsequently to increase their resistance to field infection.
   Retrospective analysis of the outbreaks identified important reservoir
   species such as quail, and demonstrated clearly the higher
   susceptibility of turkeys to infection.
   Data generated during 6 years of experience with vaccination against
   Avian Influenza (AI) indicate that it is a useful tool to limit
   secondary spread and possibly prevent the introduction of AI viruses in
   a susceptible population. The Italian AI control programme including
   vaccination was managed in a flexible manner and enabled the
   continuation of international trade. It is imperative that if
   vaccination is to be used to combat the current H5N1 epidemic it is used
   in conjunction with other measures and under official supervision. An
   extraordinary effort is required from international organisations to
   accredit control strategies so that harmonised and validated programs
   can be implemented. Transparency and sharing of field results from
   countries that are practising such programmes is crucial to the
   progressive control and ultimately the eradication of NAI infections in
   the animal reservoir. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Neosporosis by Neospora caninum causes losses to livestock production
   through abortion in cattle while, in dogs, it induces neuromuscolar

   risk factors (including the seropositivity to leishmaniosis) in dogs of
   southern Italy, determined the prevalence of N. caninum oocyst shedding
   and examined the relationship between seroprevalence of neosporosis in
   farm dogs and cattle. Using an inhibition ELISA, 20.9\% of 306 dogs had
   percent inhibition values >10 (indicative of exposure) and farm dogs had
   a significantly (p < 0.001) higher seroprevalence than dogs in a rescue
   kennel. Whilst N. caninum seroprevalence was associated with increasing
   age in dogs (p <= 0.01) there was no association between seropositivity
   for N. caninum and for Leishmania infantum. Oocysts of N. caninum were
   not detected in faecal samples from 230 dogs including 160 farm dogs.
   The results indicated that neosporosis infection is common in southern
   Italy both in dogs and in cattle and that dogs at higher risk of
   exposure are free-ranging ones living in farms. The lack of correlation
   between canine seroprevalence for N. canium and L. infantum assumes a
   particular significance in an endemic area for leishmaniosis. (C) 2007

Abstract = {{The effects of feeding 1,3/1,6 beta-glucans on the innate and the
   adaptive immune responses of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax)
   was investigated. Two experiments were carried out during the study. In
   the first, a number of non-specific immune parameters were examined at
   4, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 25 days of feeding fish with a semipurified diet
   containing Macrogard (c), a commercially available form of 1,3/1,6
   beta-glucans. The respiratory burst activity of head kidney macrophages
   isolated from the different groups of fish fed the immunostimulant
   peaked and subsequently decreased at different times during the
   experiment. Head kidney macrophages from fish fed 250 ppm beta-glucans
   had a statistically higher level of respiratory burst activity at Day 21
   of feeding compared with fish fed no immunostimulant. No statistical
   differences were observed in lyzozyme activity during this trial.
   In the second experiment, the effect of feeding 1,3/1,6 beta-glucans on
   ` the immune response of fish to an alginate-encapsulated Vibrio vaccine
   administered orally was examined ` Respiratory burst of head kidney
   macrophages and serum lysozyme activity decreased in all fish over the
   course of the trial, while serum lysozyme activity was considerably
   lower than values obtained in the first experiment. Fish vaccinated
   orally had significant increases in antibody response by Week 2
   post-vaccination, but beta-glucans did not appear to affect these
   levels. Vaccination may have resulted in activating the immune system as
   a whole, thus masking any difference in immunostimulation by the
   beta-glucans. It may be that the optimal doses and timing of
   beta-glucans administration is different when the immunostimulant is
   administered alone or in combination with the vaccine.
   In conclusion, European sea bass can be immunomodulated with oral
   administration of P-glucan. Optimal doses and administration times have
   been established when beta-glucans are fed alone, although further
   studies are needed to establish ideal feeding regimes for glucans
   administrated in combination with vaccination.}},

Abstract = {{The betanodaviruses are the causative agent of the disease viral nervous

   precursor, the CPp protein. We investigated the evolutionary
   relationships among betanodaviruses working on partial sequences of both
   RNA1 and RNA2. Phylogenetic analyses were performed by applying a
   maximum likelihood approach. The phylogenetic relationships among, the
   major betanodavirus clades SJNNV-IV, TPNNV-III, BFNNV-II and RGNNV-1
   were resolved differently in the trees obtained, respectively, from RNA1

   corroborated by strong bootstrap values. The molecular evolution of
   proteins A and CPp was also investigated. Protein A appeared to have
   evolved under strong purifying selection while the CPp protein was
   subject to both purifying and neutral selection in different amino acid
   residues. Intragenic recombination in RNA 1 and RNA2 genes was
   investigated by applying several methods and was not detected.
   Conversely reassortment of RNA 1 and RNA2 genes was demonstrated in some
   isolates. Finally RNA 1 and RNA2 genes substitution rates do not follow
   a clock-like behavior thus impeding estimation of a possible origin time

   work on the application of a vaccination programme aimed at, and
   resulting in, eradication was carried out in Italy, and was followed by
   other research, e.g. in Hong Kong and the United States of America.
   Given the spread of Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) H5N1 to three continents, vaccination is now being used on a wide
   scale under different conditions, which in most cases are not ideal.
   Although in some countries, a lack of infrastructure and resources can
   greatly limit the overall success of control programmes that encompass
   vaccination, it is imperative that international organisations set
   guidelines to `accredit' control strategies. These guidelines should
   include recommendations on seed strains to be used in vaccine
   preparations, the characteristics of the vaccine, the most appropriate
   field strategy to apply in the different phases of a control/eradication
   programme, and models of exit strategies. The availability of harmonised

   pattern of disease, costs and potential losses) and are generally
   managed by the poultry industry. In the last decade,the financial losses
   caused by the major epidemic diseases of poultry (avian influenza and
   Newcastle disease) have been enormous for both the commercial and the
   public sectors. Thus, vaccination should also be applied in the
   framework of poultry disease eradication programmes at national or
   regional levels under the official supervision of public Veterinary
   Services. This paper provides insight on the use of vaccination for the
   control of poultry infections, with particular emphasis on the control
   of transboundary poultry diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% (Advantix (R);
   Bayer AG, Germany) in a spot-on formulation was evaluated in the field
   as a control measure to prevent canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in dogs in
   an endemic area of southern Italy. In February 2005, out of 845 dogs
   initially tested for CanL, 631 dogs which tested negative (315 from a
   kennel in Bari (KB) and 316 from a kennel in Ginosa (KG)) in a
   serological and a parasitological examination were allocated to one of
   three groups: Group A-treated with imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\%
   once a month; Group B-treated every 2 weeks; and Group C-untreated
   control animals. All the dogs were examined serologically and
   parasitologically for CanL prior to the start of the study, in November
   2005 (end of the sandfly season) and in March 2006 (end of the study).
   An initial CanL seroprevalence of 24.7\% (209 dogs) was detected in KB
   and KG. In KB Leishmania infection, inferred by positivity in at least
   one of the three tests performed at the interim or final follow-up, was
   found in one animal from Group A and in nine from Group C. No positive
   animals were detected in Group B, thus giving a final protection
   efficacy of 88.9\% in Group A and 100\% in Group B. In KG Leishmania
   infection was identified in one animal from Groups A and B,
   respectively, and I I from Group C (protection efficacy of 90.36\% in
   Group A and 90.73\% in Group B). The incidence density rates (IDRs) of
   infection in both Groups A and B at each kennel were statistically
   significantly lower than that registered in Group C (KB p < 0.05 and KG
   p < 0.01). The results clearly show that a combination of imidacloprid
   10\% and permethrin 50\%, by virtue of its repellent activity against
   sandflies, is effective under both application regimes in preventing
   CanL in the field in endemic areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{17 beta-Boldenone (17 beta-BOLD) and Boldione (ADD) are steroid
   compounds with androgenic activity, likely to be used as growth
   promoters in cattle. Different studies still on-going aiming to
   distinguish between ``natural{''} occurrence or illegal BOLD source had
   already indicated that their metabolism in cattle is of relevant
   significance. To identify metabolites as in vivo markers to support the
   thesis of exogenous administration, a further approach to the in vitro
   biotransformation of 17 beta-BOLD and ADD was performed using different
   subcellular fractions obtained from both liver and kidney of untreated
   cattle. Polar and non-polar metabolites obtained from incubated parent
   compounds were formerly separated by high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) elution and successively identified by liquid
   chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) detection.
   The bovine liver was the target tissue of the main metabolic reaction
   transforming 17 beta-BOLD to ADD and vice versa. The presence of 6
   beta-hydroxy-17 beta-BOLD, produced from both compounds when NADPH was
   added as cofactors to liver post mitochondrial and microsomal fractions
   suggests that cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes could be involved in the
   biotransformation, as it occurs for 6 beta-hydroxylation of 17
   beta-testosterone. The results indicated that the urinary excretion
   profile in vivo of 6 beta-hydroxy-17 beta-BOLD and 16 alpha-hydroxy-17
   beta-BOLD could be studied together with 17 alpha- and 17 beta-BOLD as
   putative markers of BOLD treatment in cattle. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Viruses belonging to the genus Astrovirus have been increasingly
   associated with enteritis in mammalian and avian species, including
   turkeys. More recently, astroviruses have also been detected in diseased
   guinea fowl. In turkeys, two genetically distinct types of astrovirus
   have been reported, namely turkey astrovirus 1 and 2 (TAstV1 and
   TAstV2). The prevalence and the pathogenesis of astrovirus infections in
   this species is currently unknown, with the exception of data generated
   in the USA. In the present report, we have demonstrated the
   co-circulation of distinct genetic lineages of astroviruses infecting
   turkeys and guinea fowl. The predominant lineage infecting turkeys is
   genetically related to the American TAstV2, but genetic variability
   within this lineage was demonstrated. Other isolates appeared to be
   either TastV1-related or unrelated to any other known isolate.
   Astroviruses infecting guinea fowl were more closely related to TAstV2,
   and interspecies transmissions between turkeys and guinea fowl is
   suggested as a possible mechanism by which these viruses may have
   evolved, based on the genetic data available. This investigation
   provides genetic and epidemiological information contributing to a

Abstract = {{Background: Cyclophosphamide (CYP) and methotrexate (MTX) have been used
   as immunosuppressants in induction or maintenance protocols in a large
   variety of xenotransplantation models. Combining the use of transgenic
   porcine organs expressing human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) with
   immunosuppressive therapy that included the use of CYP or MTX, survival
   of primate recipients of life-supporting renal xenografts has been
   prolonged. However, both drugs can cause significant systemic toxicity
   and, in particular, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. To date only limited
   data have been reported on the histopathological features deriving from
   the use of such agents in non-human primates.
   Methods: Cyclophosphamide or MTX was used as part of the
   immunosuppressive regimen in 15 bilaterally nephrectomized non-human
   primate (Macaca fascicularis) recipients of a life-supporting hDAF
   porcine kidney. At post-mortem, a detailed analysis of the GI tract in
   animals receiving either CYP or MTX was performed. Paraffin-embedded
   sections of each portion of the GI tract were prepared and stained with
   hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E). In some animals, additional investigations
   by immunohistochemistry (CD3, C135, C1320, CD79 alpha cy, lambda, and
   kappa light chains) and by in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA
   (EBER) were undertaken.
   Results: The xenografted animals from the CYP group had a mean survival
   of 31 days (range: 0 to 90 days); animals from the MTX group survived a
   median of 14 days (range: 0 to 39 days). GI complications were the most
   frequent cause of euthanasia after renal failure. In CYP-treated animals
   GI-tract lesions were primarily characterized by diffuse, severe
   lymphoplasmocytic mucosal inflammatory infiltrate. Variable degrees of
   villi atrophy and fusion, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and
   goblet cell hyperplasia were also observed. In MTX-treated primates,
   findings were consistent with severe villi atrophy associated with
   mild-to-moderate disseminated lymphoplasmocytic infiltration.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, GI tract lesions are an early and consistent
   finding when CYP or MTX are used as induction agents in this model. The
   two compounds induce different types of GI tract damage, however, in
   agreement with their different mechanisms of action. Whilst CYP
   primarily determines inflammatory lesions, MTX leads to a degenerative
   type of damage. This study indicates that immunosuppressive drugs can
   cause severe GI tract damage in primate recipients of renal xenografts
   and may be responsible for life-threatening lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Malassezia spp. are lipophilic yeasts that are part of the normal

   This study investigated the interactions occurring between
   beta-endorphin and phospholipase activity in isolates of M.
   pachydermatis in dogs presenting cutaneous lesions. Phospholipase
   production was evaluated and quantified on 144 isolates suspended in
   Dixon broth to which different beta-endorphin concentrations (from 600
   to 0.6 pM) were added. The isolates were divided into three groups:
   group A comprised isolates from lesional skin of dogs with dermatitis
   confined to one site, group B consisted of isolates from the healthy
   skin of the same dogs with localized lesions, and group C was made up of
   isolates from assorted skin sites of healthy dogs. A statistically
   higher phospholipase activity than that of the controls was recorded in
   group B at all tested beta-endorphin concentrations. In groups A (Pz
   =0.62) and C (Pz =0.62) phospholipase activity was statistically higher
   than the controls only at a concentration of 600 pM. This study suggests
   that beta-endorphin plays an important role in the production of
   phospholipase in M. pachydermatis isolates and provides evidence that
   beta-endorphin concentrations affect the number but not the Pz value of
   phospholipase-producing isolates. B-endorphin concentrations may play a
   relevant role in inducing M. pachydermatis cell differentiation towards
   the production or non-production of phospholipase.}},

Abstract = {{In order to support eradication efforts of avian influenza (AI)
   infections in poultry, the implementation of ``differentiation of

   been recommended by international organizations. These systems enable
   the detection of field exposure in vaccinated flocks, and through this
   detection, infected flocks may be properly managed, thus interrupting
   the perpetuation of the infectious cycle. A promising system, based on
   the detection of antibodies to the nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein of AI,
   has been deemed a good candidate. However, there are presently no data
   available, in support of this DIVA system, with regard to the kinetics
   of antibody production against the NS1 proteins in poultry following
   infection. The present investigation was undertaken to establish the
   dynamics of the appearance of anti-NS1 antibodies in a naive population.
   Following experimental infection of turkeys, antibodies to a peptide
   spanning the c-terminal of the NS1 protein were detected by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) starting between day 3 and day
   5 postinfection. In contrast, no antibodies to the NS1 peptide could be
   detected in chickens over the test period. In addition, the turkeys and
   chickens reacted differently at a clinical level to the infection by the
   H9N2 challenge virus. Taken together, these findings indicate that there
   is a significant difference in the viral replication in turkeys and
   chickens, resulting in a variation in the production of antibodies to
   NS1, as detected by the peptide-based ELISA used. This fact must be
   taken into consideration when using a DIVA system based on the

   industry with the general objective of controlling, and in some
   instances eradicating, infection. The use of vaccination as a tool to
   eradicate AI requires the enforcement of a coordinated set of control
   and monitoring measures. In fact, only certain attempts at eradicating
   AI with the support of vaccination have been successful, and the outcome
   of the vaccination campaign has been shown to depend greatly on
   effective application of the field strategy that complemented the
   vaccination program. While it is taken for granted that the product and
   companion diagnostic test are suitable for that given situation, a
   monitoring system must be in place to promptly identify whether
   vaccinated birds have been field exposed, and the latter should be dealt
   with in an appropriate manner, avoiding the spread of infection to other
   premises. Prophylactic vaccination could also become a tool for AI
   management in the European Union, provided that its application is based
   on a systematic assessment of AI risk. The correct use of this tool can
   be a valuable support for the control of AI in poultry, with the added
   value of limiting the economic losses to the industry and to the
   taxpayer. Eventually, this will also reduce human exposure to
   potentially dangerous viruses.}},

   In order to determine the effect of different short-term storage
   temperatures on the activity of AI reference reagents, vials containing
   lyophilized avian influenza A antigens and antisera preparations were
   maintained at 4 C, 22 C, and 37 C over a 21-day period. At days 0, 3, 7,
   14, and 21 the reagents were titrated using the hemagglutination test,
   the hemagglutination inhibition test, or the agar gel immunodiffusion
   test (AGID). All of the AI antigens that were kept at 4 C and 22 C
   retained hemagglutinating activity for at least 21 days, but when they
   were stored at 37 C several lost their hemagglutinating activity. All of
   the reference antisera tested were still able to inhibit
   hemagglutination after 21 days, and the antigen used in AGID also gave
   clear results after 21 days even after incubation at 37 C. Our results
   therefore indicate that lyophilized avian influenza antigens maintain
   their hemagglutinating activity at temperatures between 4 C and 22 C for
   at least 21 days, and both antisera and antigens prepared for AGID
   remain stable for 21 days between 4 C and 37 C. This information will
   allow for alternative shipping temperatures than those presently
   recommended, in addition to the short-term storage of these reagents at

Abstract = {{The effect of proximity on infected premises was evaluated during the
   highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck northern
   Italy in 1999-2000 by quantifying the spatial and temporal clustering of
   cases. The epidemic was caused by an H7N1 subtype of type A influenza
   virus that originated from a low-pathogenic AI virus that spread among
   poultry farms in northeastern Italy in 1999 and eventually became
   virulent by mutation. More than 90\% of 413 infected premises were
   located in Lombardy and Veneto regions; of 382 outbreaks, 60\% occurred
   in the Lombardy region and 40\% in the Veneto region. Global and local
   spatial statistics were used to estimate the location and degree of
   clustering of cases with respect to the population at risk. Outbreaks
   were spatially clustered primarily in Lombardy, with a large cluster in
   Brescia province and another in Mantua province, on the border of
   Veneto. Time series analysis was used to assess the temporal clustering
   of outbreaks. Temporal aggregation increased during the first 5 wk and
   decreased thereafter (probably as a result of eradication measures
   enforced in the Veneto region). Spatio-temporal clustering was assessed
   considering the Temporal Risk Window (TRW), the time period during which
   premises remain infectious and infection can spread to neighboring
   premises. The clustering pattern was similar to the one detected when
   considering spatial clustering (i.e., the larger clusters were
   identified in the Brescia and Mantua provinces of Lombardy). These
   results highlight the role of proximity in the spread of AI virus and,

Abstract = {{During the 1990s, several outbreaks of avian influenza (AI), caused by
   viruses of the H9N2 subtype, were reported in poultry in various parts
   of the world. Currently, this infection seems to be endemic in poultry
   in the Middle and Far East, and the extensive circulation of H9N2 in
   poultry represents a risk factor for infection of humans, because
   viruses of this subtype have been sporadically introduced into the human
   population. Little is known about the gene constellation of the H9N2
   viruses that are currently circulating in the Middle East; thus, gene
   sequences of eight IA viruses of the H9N2 subtype isolated in Jordan in
   2003 from poultry were analyzed. The results of this investigation show
   that all eight Jordanian isolates are closely related to each other and
   to other H9N2 isolates from the Middle East. Seven of eight genes of the
   Jordanian strains show a percentage of homology not higher than 95\%
   with the genes of two H9N2 strains, A/HK/1073/99 and A/HK/1074/99,
   isolated from humans in Hong Kong. The M gene is more closely related to
   the corresponding gene of the two H9N2 human isolates from Hong Kong

Abstract = {{After a consultancy mission funded by a nongovernmental organization
   (NGO), information was collected on the dynamics of avian influenza (AI)
   infection at the rural level in a Vietnamese province with several
   ongoing outbreaks. AI outbreaks are frequent at village level due to
   environmental, ecological, agroecological, physical, social, and
   cultural factors, the underlying factor being poor hygienic conditions.
   Viral circulation is facilitated by the interactions of the integrated
   aquaculture, animal raising, horticulture agroecosystem, which relies in
   the peculiar integration of aquaculture (ponding), animal activities,
   and horticulture and by the connections with the live-bird market
   system. The interactions of these factors determine the complex system
   in which wild birds interact with domestic birds and in which people are
   constantly exposed to sources of infection, leading to the association
   between poverty and AI infection in humans. This experience underlines
   that despite all efforts by the Vietnamese Government, international
   institutions, and the NGO sector, awareness of AI at the village level
   needs to be improved. In turn, the leading institutions and
   international donors funding projects of technical cooperation aimed at
   tackling AI in Vietnam should invest in a system based on a deep
   knowledge of the practical problems of village condition to address AI
   with an effective approach. On the basis of the data collected during
   the mission, particularly on rural and semi-intensive poultry rearing
   systems, proposals that encompass the application of an effective
   vaccination strategy including backyard flocks coupled with
   dissemination of relevant information on biosecurity measures have been

Abstract = {{Meat-type turkey farms in Verona province (Veneto, Italy) have been
   affected by three low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) epidemics
   between 2000 and 2004. Control measures implemented ranged from stamping
   Out to controlled marketing in conjunction with restocking bans and
   movement restriction on live poultry, vehicles, and personnel. These
   measures were complemented with two emergency vaccination programs
   (2000-01, 2002-03) started after the beginning of the epidemics, while
   2004 outbreaks occurred in vaccinated farms. The three epidemics
   differed in the number of outbreaks, duration, and economic impact. The
   aim of the investigation was to estimate the risk of infection and the
   effect of vaccination on the LPAI epidemics affecting turkey farms in
   Verona province. Farm probability to avoid infection (Ps) was calculated
   by Kaplan-Meier for each epidemic. The vaccination effect was evaluated
   for the 2000-01 and 2002-03 epidemics considering different risk before
   or after the emergency vaccination. The epidemics and vaccination
   entered as predictors in a Cox regression model and hazard ratios (HR)
   were calculated. Ps values at the end of the epidemics were as follows:
   2000-01 = 0.66, 2002-03 = 0.51, and 2004 = 0.91. Vaccination reduced
   dramatically the risk of infection. The measures implemented had
   different effects on the three epidemics. The lower probability of being
   infected during the 2004 epidemic was most likely related to the
   protection level of the vaccinated farms acquired before the beginning
   of the epidemic, which was also responsible for the reduced spread of

Abstract = {{Avian influenza (AI) is a complex infection of birds, of which the
   ecology and epidemiology have undergone substantial changes over the
   last decade. Avian influenza viruses infecting poultry can be divided
   into two groups. The very virulent viruses cause highly pathogenic avian
   influenza (HPAI), with flock mortality as high as 100\%. These viruses
   have been restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5 and H7
   viruses cause HPAI. All other viruses cause a milder, primarily
   respiratory, disease (low pathogenic avian influenza, LPAI), unless
   exacerbated by other infections or environmental conditions. Until
   recently, HPAI viruses were rarely isolated from wild birds, but for
   LPAI viruses extremely high isolation rates have been recorded in
   surveillance studies, particularly in feral waterfowl. In recent years,
   there have been costly outbreaks of HPAI in poultry in Italy, the
   Netherlands and Canada and in each of these countries millions of birds
   were slaughtered to bring the outbreaks under control. However, these
   outbreaks tend to have been overshadowed by the H5N1 HPAI virus,
   initially isolated in China, that has now spread in poultry and/or wild
   birds throughout Asia and into Europe and Africa, resulting in the death
   or culling of hundreds of millions of poultry and posing a significant
   zoonosis threat. Since the 1990s, AI infections due to two subtypes,
   LPAI H9N2 and HPAI H5N1, have been widespread in poultry across large
   areas of the world, resulting in a modified eco-epidemiology and a
   zoonotic potential. An extraordinary effort is required to manage these
   epidemics from both the human and animal health perspectives.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that a single allometric relationship relating carcass
   lean protein (CLP) to whole body protein (WBP) can allow accurate
   estimates of CLP on pigs of different populations, sex and nutritional
   history, was tested. Three datasets of different origins were used. Data
   were representative of 548 pigs, castrated males and females, of 8 pig
   populations, serially slaughtered over ample empty body weight (EBW)
   ranges (from 22 to 217 kg). WBP and CLP ranged, respectively, from 2 to
   28 and from 1 to 16 kg. The pooled data were run and the following
   relationship was found: CLP=0.497{*}WBP1.021 (CV=0.062; rsd=0.501 kg).
   The residuals were subjected to ANOVA to test the effects due to
   dataset, pig population within dataset and sex; significant differences
   between datasets mean residuals (+0.095, SE=0.041; -0.258, SE=0.094;
   -0.116, SE=0.055 kg, P < 0.001) were observed. No differences due to sex
   and pig populations were found. The average residuals were low and only
   in few cases they differed from zero. Conclusions: CLP can be accurately
   predicted from WBP; the coefficients of this function are mainly
   influenced by the procedures of slaughtering, dissection, sampling and

   Methods and Results: For the biochemical identification methods, API 20E

   interlaboratory tests in order to determine the accuracy and concordance
   of each method. Both in intra- and interlaboratory tests, the Alsina's
   scheme showed the highest sensitivity (86\% of correct identifications
   in the interlaboratory test). False-positive results were obtained by
   all methods (specificity was 95\% for API 20E, 73\% for API 20NE and
   84\% for Alsina's scheme) and concordance varied from 65\% of API 20NE
   to 84\% of API 20E. For the molecular identifications, polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) for the detection of toxR gene, tl gene and pR72H
   fragment were tested on 30 strains by two laboratories. The PCR for toxR
   showed the highest inclusivity (96\%), exclusivity (100\%) and
   concordance (97\%).
   Conclusions: Among the biochemical identification methods tested, the
   Alsina's scheme gave more reliable results; however, in order to avoid
   false-positive results, all the biochemical identifications should be
   confirmed by means of molecular methods.

Abstract = {{Vaccination against avian influenza infection caused by H5 or H7 virus
   subtypes has been used on several occasions in recent years to control
   and in some cases eradicate the disease. In order to contain avian
   influenza infection effectively, immunization should be combined with a
   coordinated set of control and monitoring measures. The outcome of an
   immunization campaign depends on the territorial strategy; whereas the
   capacity of the veterinary services in developed countries permits
   enforcement of strategies aimed at eradicating avian influenza, many
   countries currently affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
   H5N1 viruses have a limited veterinary infrastructure and a limited
   capacity to respond to such epidemics. In these countries, resources are
   still insufficient to conduct adequate surveillance for identification
   and reaction to avian influenza outbreaks when they occur. When properly
   applied in this scenario, immunization can reduce mortality and
   production losses. In the long term, immunization might also decrease
   the prevalence of infection to levels at which stamping-out and
   surveillance can be applied. Countries should adapt their immunization
   programmes to local conditions in order to guarantee their efficacy and
   sustainability. In the initial emergency phase, human resources can be
   mobilized, with reliance on personal responsibility and motivation, thus
   compensating for potential shortcomings in organization. A more
   appropriate allocation of resources must be pursued in the long term,
   remembering that biosecurity is the main component of an exit strategy

Abstract = {{Perkinsosis is an infection of marine molluscs caused by the protistan
   parasites of the genus Perkinsus, which has been classified by the OIE
   as a disease that warrants notification. In the present study, we have
   applied a molecular genetic approach to develop an optional method for
   the specific identification of Perkinsus species.
   A species-specific polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay of the rRNA ITS region was developed to
   identify and distinguish among Perkinsus species. A taxonomic key was
   established that allows successful identification of Perkinsus species
   using a single restriction enzyme (Rsa I) to discriminate P. chesapeaki
   and P. marinus or by a combination of two endonucleases (Rsa I plus Hinf
   I) to discriminate P. olseni and P. mediterraneus. In order to validate
   the RFLP assay, the PCR products were cloned and sequenced, and its
   phylogenetic affinity was determined. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed
   the specific identification carried out by RFLPs. Herein is the first
   report of P. olseni in Manila clams from the NW Adriatic Sea (Italy),
   which we identified by employing this method. The PCR-RFLP assay herein
   described may be useful to provide accurate, rapid and inexpensive
   identification of Perkinsus species, and may aid in ongoing

Abstract = {{Gastric habronemosis of horses caused by Habronema microstoma and
   Habronema muscae (Nematoda, Spirurida) is characterized by catarrhal
   gastritis, diarrhoea, progressive weight loss and ulcers. Despite its
   importance in the equine industry and in clinical practice, knowledge of
   the epidemiology of this infection is still incomplete as diagnosis in
   live animals is challenging. A two-step semi-nested PCR assay using
   ribosomal DNA (rDNA) markers has recently been used for the molecular
   diagnosis in vivo of gastric habronemosis based on the detection of H.
   microstoma and/or H. muscae DNA in equine faeces. To evaluate the field
   efficacy of this assay, a molecular epidemiological survey was carried
   out on equid gastric habronemosis in central Italy. One hundred and
   fifty-three individual faecal samples were collected from live native
   horses and subjected to both coprological examination and the two-step
   semi-nested PCR. When flotation procedures were performed no horse
   tested positive for Habronema spp. larvated eggs while 96 animals
   (61.2\%) were positive for other endoparasites (i.e. strongyles,
   oxyurids, ascarids). Two-step semi-nested PCR detected 86 samples
   (53.6\%) that were positive for H. microstoma and/or H. muscae DNA. H.

Abstract = {{Intensified official veterinary controls on warehouses supplying Chinese
   retailers resulted in the seizure of smuggled poultry products. Frozen
   and vacuum-packed frozen raw duck and chicken carcasses, and anatomic
   parts ( legs) of these species, were collected and processed for
   laboratory investigations aiming at the detection of avian influenza
   virus. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (
   RRT-PCR) targeting the M gene, performed on the lung and trachea from
   duck and chicken carcasses, yielded positive results. Virus isolation
   attempts in specific pathogen free embryonated eggs yielded an H10N7
   virus from the duck carcass. The isolate had an intravenous
   pathogenicity index of 0.0, and phylogenetic analysis revealed a
   nucleotide homology of 97 and 96\% with virus A/duck/Zhejiang/52/2000 (
   H5N1) for the PB2 and NS genes, respectively. The results of this study
   indicate that low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses may be
   introduced into a country through trade of carcasses regardless of the
   non-systemic nature of this disease. The export ban applied to countries
   affected by the H5N1 epidemic may result in increased smuggling of
   poultry products, which remains one of the means by which influenza
   viruses can cross-national boundaries. Increased surveillance at borders

Abstract = {{Microsporum canis has been frequently isolated from human cases of tinea
   capitis and tinea corporis. The infection may be acquired from infected
   animals with cutaneous lesions but also from asymptomatic carriers or
   from the environment. As asymptomatic M. canis carriers are considered
   to be a critical factor in the epidemiology of dermatophytosis in
   humans, this study investigated the relationship between the presence of
   dermatophytes on the hair coats of dogs and cats without cutaneous
   lesions and the occurrence of the disease in their respective owners. A
   total of 136 dogs and 248 cats were sampled from January 1999 to January
   2005. Seventy-eight animals (22 dogs and 56 cats) belonged to
   individuals affected by tinea corporis caused by M. canis and 306 (114
   dogs and 192 cats) to individuals without dermatophytosis. Age, sex,
   breed, habitat and season were recorded for each animal and examined as
   potential risk factors. Dermatophytes were isolated from 20.5\% of the
   dogs and 28.2\% of the cats. Microsporum canis was isolated from 36.4\%
   of dogs cohabiting with owners diagnosed with tinea corporis but it was
   never isolated from dogs whose owners had no lesions. By contrast, M.
   canis was isolated from 53.6\% of cats cohabiting with owners diagnosed
   with tinea corporis and from 14.6\% of cats whose owners had no signs of
   the disease. These results clearly indicate that both cats and dogs
   should be considered as a major source of pathogenic dermatophytes for
   humans even when they do not present clinical signs of dermatophytosis.}},

Abstract = {{In order to support eradication efforts of avian influenza (AI)
   infections in poultry, the implementation of ``DIVA:' vaccination
   strategies, enabling the Differentiation of Infected from Vaccinated
   Animals have been recommended by international organisations. A system,
   based on the detection of antibodies to the Non-Structural 1 (NS1)
   protein of AI has been proposed but the success of such a system lies in
   the conservation of the NS 1 protein among different Al isolates. With
   this in mind, the ns1 gene of 40 influenza A viruses isolated from a
   spectrum of avian species was sequenced and compared phylogenetically.
   The isolates included both low pathogenicity (LPAI) (n = 22) and highly
   pathogenic (HPAI) (n = 18) viruses of the H7 subtype and were
   representative of the avian influenza viruses that circulated in
   Northern Italy from 1999 to 2003. Size variation in the predicted
   an-lino acid sequence of each NS1 was revealed with two different levels
   of carboxy-terminal truncation being observed. Of the 40 isolates
   analysed. 16 had a full-length NS1 protein of 230 aa, 6 had a truncated
   protein of 220 aa and 18 had an intermediate truncation resulting in a
   protein of 224 aa. All of the H7N1 HPAI isolates possessed the
   intermediate carboxy-terminal truncation. In addition, all of the H7N1
   LPAI viruses circulating at the beginning of the epidemic had a full
   length NS1 while those circulating towards the end of the period had a
   truncated protein. To determine whether modifications to NS1 could be a
   result of laboratory manipulation, two strains (A/ty/Italy/977/99 and
   A/ck/Italy/1082/99) with a full length NS1 were inoculated into
   10-day-old embryonated chicken and 12-day-old embryonated turkey eggs
   via the allantoic route for 20 blind passages and sequenced at passages
   3, 10, and 20. No truncation was observed following these,serial
   passages. To determine whether the truncation involved an immunogenic
   region of the NS 1 protein a peptide spanning residues 219 aa to 230 aa
   was synthesized and tested in an indirect ELISA against sera obtained
   from turkeys experimentally infected with a virus strain known to have a
   full length NS I protein. The peptide proved to be immunogenic
   highlighting the fact that the variations of the NS1 protein presented
   in this work must to be taken into consideration when developing a
   diagnostic test based on the identification of antibodies to the NS1
   protein. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 9-year-old, male French Bulldog was examined for a subcutaneous mass
   located at the site of a microchip Implant. Cytologic examination of the
   mass was suggestive of a malignant mesenchymal neoplasm. Histologically,
   the mass was confirmed as a high-grade infiltrative fibrosarcoma, with
   multifocal necrosis and peripheral lymphoid aggregates. By
   immunohistochemistry, the sample was investigated for vimentin,
   smooth-muscle actin (SMA), CD3, CD79 alpha, and CD18. All the neoplastic
   cells were positive for vimentin. Scattered cells at the periphery of
   the lesion were also positive for SMA, highlighting a myofibroblastic
   phenotype. The lymphoid cells were positive for CD18 and CD3. No
   aluminum deposits were detected by the aurintricarboxylic acid method. A
   diagnosis of fibrosarcoma morphologically similar to feline
   postinjection sarcomas was made. Fibrosarcomas at the site of injections
   have been reported in dogs and ferrets. Furthermore, neoplastic growth
   at the site of microchip implant in dog and laboratory rodents has been
   described.}},

Abstract = {{Avian influenza ( AI) is a listed disease of the World Organisation for
   Animal Health (OIE) that has become a disease of great importance both
   for animal and human health. The increased relevance of AI in the fields
   of animal and human health has highlighted the lack of scientific
   information on several aspects of the disease, which has hampered the
   adequate management of some of the recent crises. Millions of animals
   have died, and there is growing concern over the loss of human lives and
   over the management of the pandemic potential.
   The present paper aims to identify areas of knowledge of veterinary
   competence that need to be improved in order to generate information to
   support the global AI crisis, and highlights the major changes in AI
   legislation, including regulations related to trade. It also reviews the
   human health implications of AI, including the mechanisms by which a
   human pandemic virus may be generated, and the food safety issues
   related to this infection. The application of control policies, ranging
   from stamping out to emergency and prophylactic vaccination, are
   discussed on the basis of data generated in recent outbreaks, and in the
   light of new regulations, also in view of the maintenance of good animal
   welfare.
   Poultry veterinarians working for the industry or for the public sector
   represent the first line of defence against the pandemic threat and for
   the prevention and control of this infection in poultry and in wild
   birds. However, given the current situation, it is imperative that close
   collaboration is sought and achieved by health officials involved in the
   veterinary, agricultural and medical aspects of the disease. Only
   through the exchange of data, experiences, views and information will it
   be possible to combat this zoonosis, which represents a major threat to
   public health and animal well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Anellovirus is a recently created, floating genus of viruses. Torque
   teno virus (TTV), the type species in the genus, was first discovered in
   a human patient with a post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology.
   Recently, TTV genetically related to but distinct from those discovered
   in humans have also been found in animals, including pigs. The aims of
   this study were to estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Italian pig
   herds and some risk factors possibly associated with this infection.
   Serum samples from 179 healthy pigs from 10 farms located in
   north-central Italy were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the
   presence of swine TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in the sera of 43 pigs
   (24.0\%), coming from eight of the 10 farms examined. Prevalence was
   significantly higher in finishing herds (40.1\%) than in
   farrow-to-finish herds (11.0\%) and did not depend on the size of the
   herd. Within the finishing herds the prevalence was significantly higher
   in weaners (57.4\%) than in fatteners (22.9\%), but this difference was
   not observed in farrow-to-finish herds. No relationship was observed
   between the prevalence of swine TTV and the implementation of some
   general hygiene practices and biosecurity procedures within the herds.}},

   Since adhesins, that anchor bacteria to the extracellular matrix (ECM),

   protein A, clumping factor A and collagen adhesin) as target in a DNA
   vaccine. Intranasal immunization with a pDNA mixture coding the four
   adhesins, triggered significant levels of specific serum and mucosal Ig
   that inhibited S. aureus adhesion to cow mammary gland epithelial cells
   in vitro. Splenocytes of immunized mice challenged in vitro with S.
   aureus extracts showed a strong proliferative response. Finally,
   immunized mice were significantly protected against intramammary
   challenge with S. aureus. Our data confirm the feasibility of a genetic
   mucosal vaccine targeting S. aureus adhesins and prompt further study to

Abstract = {{Avian influenza ( AI) infections have become of growing importance both
   for animal and human health. Vaccination has become a recommended tool

   effective tool in increasing the resistance of birds to field challenge,
   preventing clinical signs and reducing viral shedding in the
   environment. The companion diagnostic test to the vaccine, however, has
   been only partially validated in the field against one subtype of
   neuraminidase ( N1). The present paper presents the results of a full
   laboratory and field validation of the diagnostic test developed to
   detect antibodies to the N3 subtype of AI in vaccinated and unvaccinated
   chickens and turkeys. Antibody kinetic studies conducted in the
   laboratory have shown that antibodies to the N protein may be detected
   earlier than antibodies to the haemagglutinin. The data derived from
   this extensive validation trial indicate the excellent capability of
   this assay in detecting the presence of active AI infection at an early

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of risk factors and control policies following
   the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic that struck
   northern Italy's Poultry industry in the winter of 1999-2000. The
   epidemic was caused by a type-A influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype,
   that originated from a low-pathogenic AI virus which spread among
   Poultry farms in northeastern Italy in 1999 and eventually became
   virulent by mutation. Most infected premises (IP) were located in the
   regions of Lombardy and Veneto (382 out of 413, 92.5\%), and the
   eradication measures provided for in the European legislation were
   enforced. In Veneto, where flock density was highest, infection-control
   was also accomplished by means of depopulation of susceptible flocks
   through a ban on restocking and pre-emptive slaughter of flocks that
   were in the vicinities of or that had dangerous contacts with IPs. In
   Lombardy, such control measures were applied to a lesser extent.
   Infection incidence rate (IR) was 2.6 cases per 1000 flocks per day in
   Lombardy and 1.1 in Veneto. After the implementation of
   infection-control measures, the at-risk population, the percentage of
   flocks <= 1.5 km from IPs, and the HPAI-IR underwent a greater reduction
   in Veneto than in Lombardy. Although the proximity (<= 1.5 km) to IN in
   the temporal risk window (TRW) was a major risk factor for HPAI at the
   individual flock level, its effect at the population level
   (population-attributable fraction) did not exceed 31.3\%. Viral
   transmission therefore also occurred among relatively distant flocks.
   Turkey flocks were characterised by grerater IR of HPAI compared with
   other bird Species Such as layer hens, broilers, gamebirds, and
   waterfowl, even when located at distances > 1.5 km from IPs. In
   Lombardy, IR for species other than turkeys was also relatively high.

Abstract = {{Since 1997, north-eastern Italy has been repeatedly challenged by avian
   influenza (AI) infections caused by viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes.
   The penetration of such infections in the industrial circuit in densely
   populated poultry areas (DPPAs) resulted in massive spread, and early
   attempts to control Al only by stamping-out and restriction policies
   resulted in death or culling of millions of birds. The re-emergence or
   the introduction of Al viruses in the same DPPA resulted in the
   development of an emergency vaccination programme based on the use of
   heterologous vaccination and a companion discriminatory test. By
   enabling the detection of field exposure in vaccinated animals, the
   application of this system, in conjunction with a monitoring programme
   and a well-defined territorial strategy has resulted in the eradication
   of H7N1 and H7N3 epidemics that occurred between 2000 and 2004.
   Retrospective analysis of the Al outbreaks in north-eastern Italy
   coupled with surveillance programmes in wild birds and in hobby flocks
   indicating that certain areas are at continuous high risk of infection,
   was the rationale for developing and implementing a bivalent H5/H7 pilot
   vaccination programme in a restricted area of the DPPA. Laboratory and
   field evidence indicate that vaccinated animals are more resistant to
   challenge and shed lower amounts of virus, thus acting as a tool for
   both prevention and control, thus limiting the impact of Al infections.}},

   Stool samples of 62 tortoises (37 T. hermanni hermanni, 13 T. graeca, 6
   T. hermanni boettgeri and 6 T. marginata) were macroscopically examined
   and subjected to qualitative (flotation and Baermann techniques) and

Abstract = {{Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) based on soluble antigens
   derived from promastigote or amastigote-like stages of Leishmania
   infantum and on the recombinant rK39 antigen, each in combination with
   different conjugates {[}anti-immunoglobulin G1 {[}IgG1], anti-IgG2,
   anti-IgG(gamma), and anti-IgG heavy plus light chains], were compared to
   an immunofluorescent-antibody test (IFAT) and two commercially available
   rapid test systems (DiaMed-Vet-IT Leish and ID-PaGIA canine
   leishmaniasis antibody test) for the detection of specific
   anti-Leishmania antibodies in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs with
   proven L. infantum infections. ELISAs based on soluble promastigote and
   amastigote antigens had very high sensitivities in symptomatic (n = 30;
   100\%) and asymptomatic dogs (n = 17; 94.1 to 100\%), except when
   combined with the anti-IgG1 conjugate (41.2 to 82.4\%). Specificities
   were high for all combinations (n = 50; 96 to 100\%). The rK39 ELISA
   detected fewer asymptomatic cases (sensitivities, 52.9 to 64.7\%) but
   was highly specific (96 to 100\%). The IFAT was 90\% sensitive in
   symptomatic dogs but was significantly less sensitive in asymptomatic
   cases (29.4\%). However, it had an excellent specificity (100\%). Test
   performances of the rapid tests based on the rK39 antigen were
   comparable to the ELISAs based on the same antigen. ELISAs based on
   soluble promastigote or amastigote antigens seem to be most suited for
   the serological diagnosis of canine Leishmania infections in both
   symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. IFAT and the rK39 ELISA lack
   sensitivity in asymptomatic cases but are highly specific. Rapid tests
   like the rK39 dipstick test or the ID-PaGIA are helpful for confirming
   clinically suspected cases because of their high specificities in
   symptomatic animals.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present work was to develop two new independent SYBR
   Green I-based real-time PCR assays for both detection and quantification
   of betanodavirus, an RNA virus that infects several species of marine
   teleost fish causing massive mortalities in larvae and juveniles. The
   assays utilized two pairs of primers targeting highly conserved regions
   of both the RNA molecules forming the betanodavirus genome: RNAI
   encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and RNA2 encoding the
   coat protein (CP). The specificity of amplifications was monitored by
   the melting analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplified
   products. The applicability of these assays was confirmed with 21
   betanodavirus strains, covering all the four main clades. In addition, a
   BLAST (NCBI) search with the primer sequences showed no genomic
   cross-reactivity with other viruses. The new assays were able to
   quantify concentrations of betanodavirus genes ranging from 10(1) to 108
   copies per reaction. The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of
   threshold cycle (C-t) values of the assays were 1.5\% and 1.4\% for CP
   and RdRP RNAs, respectively. The inter-assay CVs of C-t values were
   2.3\% and 2.4\% for CP and RdRP RNAs, respectively. Moreover, regression
   analysis showed a significant correlation (R-2 > 0.97) between genome
   number, as determined by real-time PCR assays and the corresponding
   virus titer expressed as TCID(50/)ml of two different betanodavirus
   strains propagated in cell culture. The two assays were compared with a
   previously established one-step RT-PCR assay and with the classical
   virus isolation test and found to be more sensitive. In conclusion, the
   developed real-time RT-PCR assays are a reliable, specific and sensitive
   tool for the quantitative diagnosis of betanodavirus. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Horse gastrointestinal myiasis caused by larvae of Gasterophilus spp.
   (Diptera, Oestridae) flies has a worldwide distribution and, where
   present, it is primarily caused by larvae of Gasterophilus intestinalis
   and Gasterophilus nasalis. Other species, i.e., Gasterophilus inermis,
   Gasterophilus pecorum and Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis, present in
   different or in the same regions of the gastrointestinal tract, were
   only occasionally reported in very limited areas of eastern European
   Countries and in central Italy. With the aim to contribute data on the
   species composition of Gasterophilus and on the seasonal variation of
   the infection pattern in southern Italy, 152 native horses were
   necropsied from January to December 2003 and Gasterophilus larvae were
   collected from the stomach, the small intestine and the rectum of each
   of them. On the whole, 125 (82.2\%) horses were infected by larvae of
   Gasterophilus spp. and 214 second stage larvae (L 2) and 13,342 third
   stage larvae (U) collected. Five species of Gasterophilus were
   identified with the following prevalence: G. intestinalis = 95.2\%, G.
   nasalis = 44.8\%, G. inermis = 15.2\%, G. pecorum = 2.6\% and G.
   haemorrhoidalis = 0.8\%. L3 were retrieved throughout the observation
   period with the highest mean burdens from January to August 2003 while
   the lowest mean was registered from September to November 2003. L2 were
   collected in February-March 2003 and from September to December 2003.
   The majority of the animals (n = 66, 43.4\%) were infected with a single
   Gasterophilus species, however, 45 animals (29.6\%) harboured 2 species,
   12 animals (7.9\%) 3 species and 2 animals (1.3\%) 4 species. The trend
   of abundance in the L3 of G. intestinalis and G. nasalis, the most
   represented species, was highly concordant (r = 0.5, p < 0.001). A
   retrospective comparison of our results and of other data from four
   seasons of observation (1983-1986) in central Italy showed that the
   number of G. inermis, G. pecorum and G. haemorrhoidalis have been
   decreasing relative to G. intestinalis and G. nasalis which may suggest
   tendency toward the extinction of the three former species of
   Gasterophilus. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The application of a selective culling programme in two scrapie affected

   of this breed and the sensitivity of different diagnostic methods in the
   pre-clinical diagnosis of scrapie were also investigated. Overall, 2,068
   clinically healthy sheep underwent PrP genotyping, providing the basis
   for selective culling. The prevalence of scrapie infection was
   investigated in susceptible sheep by two independent diagnostic methods.
   All the sheep older than 18 months (n = 620) were tested by Prionics(R)
   Check Western rapid test on the obex, with a prevalence of infection of
   3.9\%. Furthermore, 385 sheep underwent immunohistochemistry (IHC) on
   retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN), with a prevalence of infection of
   5.2\%. Overall, 32 sheep were diagnosed with pre-clinical scrapie. Of
   these, 31 were positive by Western blot on the spleen, 29 by IHC on the
   RPLN and tonsil, 28 by IHC on the obex, 24 by rapid test, and only 18 by
   IHC on the third eyelid. All the scrapie positive sheep were of the
   ARQ/ARQ, ARQ/AHQ or ARQ/VRQ genotypes. No significant differences in
   scrapie prevalence were observed among these genotypes. The estimated
   risk of the three targeted alleles was also similar, suggesting that in
   this breed the VRQ allele was not at higher risk for scrapie, compared
   to the ARQ and AHQ alleles.}},

Abstract = {{The present survey collected and analyzed the results of routine testing
   for Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes on foods of animal
   origin submitted for official controls in Italy during 2001 to 2002.
   Salmonella was detected in 2.2\% of 71,643 food samples examined, and
   the isolation rates ranged from 9.9\% for raw poultry meat to less than
   0.1\% for dairy products. Isolation rates were also high in raw pork
   (4.9\%) and processed meats (5.3\%), which often involved pork. Low
   rates were observed in seafood (0.5\%) and in ready-to-eat foods, such
   as grocery products (0.7\%) and ice creams (0.1\%). Serotyping showed
   that approximately 50\% of the isolates belonged to the serotypes most
   commonly isolated from humans in Italy, thus confirming that most cases
   of human salmonellosis have a foodborne origin. Levels of L.
   monocytogenes were higher than what is accepted by the current
   regulation in 2.4\% of 42,300 food samples. The positivity rates ranged
   from 10.3\% in raw pork to none in eggs and egg products. Contamination
   rates were higher in other meat products (between 2 and 5\%) and fish
   (6.5\%) than in cheeses (1.1\%) and other dairy products (0.6\%).
   Routine control activities on the microbial contamination of foods can
   generate data with statistical and epidemiological value. Such data can
   be used as a basis for estimating the exposure of consumers to foodborne
   pathogens, following the trends of contamination over time, and
   evaluating the effects of control measures on the contamination of food.}},

   group were then sub-grouped according to their age and weight. Two
   different treatments were administered (time 0 and +28 days) to groups A
   and B, and the dogs were checked weekly for tick infestation until day
   +56 post-treatment (p.t.). Twenty-four areas distributed on the whole
   body surface were examined for ticks at each follow-up, while only at
   time 0 and at day +56 p.t., ticks were collected from the dogs and
   identified.
   For the immature stages a semi-quantitative method was adopted and the
   load of immature stages was evaluated and grouped into four classes up
   to day +56 p.t. when the mean number of immature ticks (MIT) for each
   infection class was evaluated.
   All the adult ticks collected were identified as brown dog ticks
   (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Immature stages were first compared at day
   +28 p.t.. The efficacy of both products used in groups A and B on adult
   ticks was high and generally very similar. Conversely, the efficacy of
   imidacloprid 10\% and permethrin 50\% against immatures was higher than
   that of fipronil 10\% and methoprene 12\% throughout the observation
   period with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) at day +28
   p.t. (i.e. group A = 98.52\%, group B = 72.40\%). imidacloprid 10\% and
   permethrin 50\% was more effective than fipronil 10\% and methoprene
   12\%, with the differences being statistically significant at day +28
   p.t. (group A = 98.43\%, group B = 77.56\%). (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fish pasteurellosis is an infectious disease that affects several
   teleost species living in temperate marine waters. The pathogen
   responsible, Photobacterium damselae subspecies piscicida, shows high
   genetic similarity with P. damselae subsp. damselae, making subspecies
   discrimination extremely laborious. Here we report for the first time a
   PCR-RFLP method for the identification of P. damselae subsp. piscicida
   without prior isolation in pure culture. Genomic sequence information
   was obtained through cloning and sequencing of RAPD products. Two P.
   damselae-specific primer pairs were developed and tested on 17 strains
   of P. damselae subsp. piscicida, 10 strains of P. damselae subsp.
   damselae, and 6 closely related control species. High sensitivity was
   achieved in PCR amplification on serially diluted samples (< 180 fg of
   pure bacterial DNA or < 10 fg, depending on the amplified fragment).
   Restriction analysis of PCR products showed a unique digestion profile
   for all P. damselae subsp. piscicida strains. The same PCR-RFLP method
   was implemented on total DNA samples extracted from experimentally
   infected sea bream and sea bass. Positive results were obtained on fish
   with clear signs of the disease as well as on challenged, but
   asymptomatic, fish. The method presented here might provide a useful
   tool for both prevention and rapid diagnosis of fish pasteurellosis.}},

Abstract = {{Oral vaccination of foxes (OVF) is a powerful tool to combat rabies in
   wildlife, and large parts of western Europe have been freed from rabies
   using this tool. Nevertheless, the success of OVF. given with the number
   of campaigns needed to eliminate the disease, depends on many factors.
   This article for the first time focuses on and assesses difference in
   OVF with respect to the spatial setting of vaccinated areas with time.
   The size of the areas vaccinated with time and the size of the
   overlapping area of consecutively vaccinated areas are particularly
   considered. In order to integrate these two aspects into one single
   figure, an Area Index is proposed ranging between 0 and 1. A statistical
   analysis indicates that the number of campaigns needed for rabies
   elimination significantly decreases on condition that the total rabies
   endemic area is consecutively treated right from the beginning of oral
   vaccination, Hence, from an economical and environmental point of view,
   vaccination areas should be selected the way that guarantees an Area
   Index close to 1, The concept of an Area Index, as described here, is a
   useful tool not only in the context of OVF, but it could also be used
   for other control schemes against infectious diseases in wildlife.}},

Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{127-137}},
Abstract = {{Twenty-six multiparous Italian Holstein cows were used to compare two
   feeding strategies for the prepartum period. Cows were allocated to two
   dietary treatments on the basis of their parity (3.1 +/- 1.1) and mature
   equivalent production (11473 +/- 1449 kg). From 20 +/- 7 d precalving to
   the calving day, one group of 13 cows (parity = 3.1 +/- 1.0; mature
   equivalent production = 11473 1606 kg) was fed a Control diet made by
   mixing a 50:50 as fed combination of the far off dry ration and the
   lactation diet fed postpartum. The remaining cows (parity = 3.1 1.1;
   mature equivalent production = 11473 1338 kg) were fed a prepartum diet
   (Anionic) obtained by supplementing the far off dry ration with energy
   and protein sources plus calcium chloride. This diet had a lower dietary
   cation-anion difference than the Control diet (7.35 vs 26.66 meq/100 g
   DM; P<0.05) and it induced a significant decrease in the cows' urine pH
   (7.58 vs 7.95; P<0.01). Cows fed the Anionic diet had the lowest DM
   intake during the prepartum (12.0 vs 13.4 kg/d; P<0.01), but at
   parturition they showed a limited drop in plasma Ca reducing the
   incidence of subclinical hypocalcaemia in comparison with the Control
   group (8 vs 62\%; P<0.01). No differences due to the prepartum diet were
   observed for the plasma levels of several indicators of hepatic function
   (aspartate-amino transferase, Y-glutamil transferase, creatin-kinase and
   bilirubine). After calving, all the cows were co-mingled and fed the
   same lactation ration and those that had received the Anionic diet
   during the prepartum showed a significant increase in milk yield with no
   changes in milk quality. Average production at the peak of lactation was
   43.8 kg/d for Control cows while it raised up to 47.8 kg/d (P<0.05) for
   the animals fed the Anionic diet during the prepartum. This positive
   result was obtained with a lower loss in cows' body condition score
   measured at 30 and 60 days in milk and without any effect on the uterine
   involution process. The use of the Anionic diet has proven to be an
   effective alternative to the common practice of feeding close-up diets
   made by a partial replacement of the far off dry ration with the diet
   fed to the lactating cows. This strategy should be particularly
   recommended for dairy herds in which there is a great incidence of
   metabolic and health problems related to clinical or subclinical
   hypocalcaemia in the early postpartum.}},

   population size of Malassezia yeasts. Malassezia yeasts were isolated
   from 72.9\% and 40\% of the cats and from 57.3\% and 28.0\% of the dogs,
   with and without otitis externa, respectively. Malassezia was frequently
   isolated from animals under 5 years of age. The highest prevalence of
   positive samples was reported in winter for cats and in autumn for dogs.
   Dogs with pendulous ears showed a higher incidence of infection than
   dogs with erect ears. More Malassezia yeasts were recovered from animals
   with otitis (i.e. 59.6 colony forming units - CFUs - for cats and 66.0
   CFUs for dogs) than healthy animals. Out of the 413 isolates obtained
   from animals with and without otitis, 403 (97.6\%) were identified as M.
   pachydermatis and 10 (2.4\%) as M. globosa. A statistical evaluation of
   the occurrence of Malassezia yeasts in dogs and cats revealed that
   predisposing factors for Malassezia infections are sampling period for
   cats, and type of ear for dogs. The largest population of Malassezia
   yeasts was detected in animals with otitis, suggesting a role in the
   occurrence of lesions.}},

Abstract = {{A case of conjunctival lymphoma in a 4-year-old Siberian husky is
   reported. A large red mass protruding from the conjunctiva of the upper
   eyelid of the right eye was present. Irritation, blepharospasm and
   epiphora were revealed on initial ophthalmic examination. After
   anti-inflammatory treatment, surgery was performed. Histologically, the
   mass consisted of large polygonal cells with a high nucleus to cytoplasm
   ratio, moderate amounts of slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, pleomorphic
   nuclei with vesicular chromatin and prominent multiple nucleoli. Mitotic
   figures were frequent. Approximately 70\% of the neoplastic cells were
   CD3 positive and CD79alpha negative. On the basis of histologic and
   immunohistochemical findings, a diagnosis of intermediate-grade, diffuse
   large-cell lymphoma with T-cell immunophenotype was made. The surgical
   area healed uneventfully and, although chemotherapy was not received,
   after 12 months the dog exhibited no recurrence. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of unicentric extranodal
   conjunctival lymphoma in a dog.}},

Abstract = {{Silymarin, the standardized extract of Silybum marianum, is used as a
   hepatoprotector in man, and is a potent antihepatotoxic agent. This
   study focused on the effects of a silymarin-phospholipid complex in
   reducing the toxic effects of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in broiler
   chickens. Twenty-one 14-d-old male commercial broilers were randomly
   allotted to 3 groups and treated as follows: basal diet alone {[}Group C
   (Control)]; AFB(1) at 0.8 mg/kg of feed {[}Group 131]; AFB(1) at 0.8
   mg/kg of feed plus silymarin phytosome, a silymarin complexed form with
   phospholipids from soy, at 600 mg/kg of BW {[}Group B-1+Sil].
   Considering the whole growth cycle, BW gain and feed intake were lower
   in AFB(1)-treated birds with respect to controls (P < 0.05). In the
   B-1+Sil group, BW gain and feed intake were higher with respect to birds
   receiving AFB(1) alone (P < 0.05), and not different from the control
   birds. Serum biochemistry showed no difference among groups, except for
   a decrease of alanine amino transferase (ALT) in chicks treated only
   with AFB(1). Alanine amino transferase activity in AFB(1) plus silymarin
   phytosome treated birds was not different from the controls. No
   treatment differences were noted on liver weight. In conclusion, our
   results suggest that silymarin phytosome can provide protection against
   the negative effects of AFB1 on performance of broiler chicks.}},

Abstract = {{The precision of the disc diffusion protocols previously published by
   Alderman and Smith (Aquaculture 196 (2002) 211) was analysed in a
   seven-laboratory trial using Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 as the test
   strain. Discs containing seven antimicrobial agents were employed and
   2899 zone size measurements were generated. The total data generated in
   the trial was used to quantify the intra- and inter-laboratory
   precisions. The study design also facilitated the investigation of the
   influence of the source of media and the source of discs on zone sizes.
   A smaller two-laboratory trial was employed to investigate the influence
   of incubation time of zone size.
   The intra-laboratory precision was relatively high with the mean of the
   coefficients of variation calculated for each laboratory and each agent
   being 4.7\%. In contrast, the inter-laboratory precision was very much
   lower with the mean of the values for each agent being 11.1\%.
   Significant influences on zone size were detected for all three
   parameters of the protocol. Media source effects were particularly
   notable with respect to oxytetracycline and oxolinic acid discs, disc
   source effects with respect to ampicillin and
   sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim discs and incubation times with the
   ampicillin and amoxycillin discs. ANOVA analysis of the total data set
   confirmed that inter-laboratory variation was the major factor
   influencing the low precision of the protocol.
   The overall precision of the protocols used here was found to be
   significantly lower than that implied by the control limits associated
   with the same bacterium in other validated disc diffusion protocols. The
   implications of these results, for the further development of the
   protocols under investigation, are discussed. (C) 2004 Published by

Abstract = {{A total of 3879 samples of foodstuffs were examined for the presence of
   Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC O157). The survey
   was conducted by 9 of the 10 Italian Veterinary Public Health
   Laboratories. Samples were collected between May 2000 and September 2001
   in 14 regions and comprised 931 minced beef specimens and 2948 dairy
   products (DP) with less than 60 days of ripening. The DP included 657
   pasteurised and 811 unpasteurised bovine DP, 477 pasteurised and 502
   unpasteurised ovine DP, and 501 water-buffalo's milk mozzarella cheese.
   Samples were collected at retail level, from plants processing minced
   beef and dairy plants and from farms directly manufacturing cheeses. All
   the samples were tested using a sensitive procedure based on ISO/DIS
   16654:1999 (later ISO 16654:2001), which includes an immunomagnetic
   separation step. A preliminary inter-laboratory trial was organised with
   artificially contaminated samples to assess the ability of all the
   participating laboratories to isolate E. coli O157 by the established
   procedure.
   VTEC O157 was isolated from four (0.43\%) of the minced beef samples,
   collected in four different regions and during different months, but was
   not detected in any of the dairy products. E. coli O157 VT(-)eae(+) was
   isolated from one raw cow's milk cheese. This survey provided national
   data on the presence of VTEC O157 in foodstuffs, demonstrating a low
   prevalence of the organism. The survey also encouraged updating of
   knowledge and procedures on VTEC O157 in laboratories with official
   responsibility for microbiological testing of foods of animal origin.

   for legislative purposes and for international trade. This has led to a
   new proposed definition of `avian influenza' to extend all infections
   caused by H5 and H7 viruses regardless of their virulence as notifiable
   diseases, although this has encountered some difficulties in being
   approved.
   The paper also reviews the major outbreaks caused by viruses of the H5
   or H7 subtype and the control measures applied. The zoonotic aspects of
   avian influenza, which until 1997 were considered to be of limited
   relevance in human medicine, are also discussed. The human health
   implications have now gained importance, both for illness and fatalities
   that have occurred following natural infection with avian viruses, and
   for the potential of generating a reassortant virus that could give rise

   (RRT-PCR), both targeting the M gene. The results indicate that in
   experimentally infected turkeys VI was positive from the pooled tracheal
   swabs collected from day 3 to day 10. One-step RT-PCR was able to detect
   influenza RNA from samples collected from day 3 to day 12, while RRT-PCR
   amplified influenza RNA in swabs collected from day 3 to day 15. The
   AC-EIA test yielded positive results between day 5 and day 10
   post-infection. On field samples, the K value between the AC-EIA and VI
   tests was 0.82. Compared with VI, the relative sensitivity of this test
   was 88.9\% (CI95 = 85.2-92.6) and the relative specificity was 95.7\%
   (CI95 = 93.7- 97.7). The K value between the RT-PCR and VI tests was
   0.88. Compared with virus isolation, the relative sensitivity of the
   one-step RT-PCR was 95.6\% (CI95 = 93.1-98.0) and the relative
   specificity was 96.3\% (CI95 = 94.4-98.1). The K value between the
   RRT-PCR and VI tests was 0.92. Compared with virus isolation, the
   relative sensitivity and specificity of RRT-PCR was 93.3\% (CI95 =
   90.4-96.3) and 98.4\% (CI95 = 97.2-99.6), respectively. Generally
   speaking, comparison between virus isolation, the AC-EIA test and the
   two nucleic acid detection methods indicated excellent agreement. Data
   obtained from both experimental and field study suggest a higher
   sensitivity of the PCR-based methods compared with the AC-EIA. The
   economical and practical implications of using one of the rapid tests as
   an alternative to VI during an avian influenza epidemic are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to investigate the secretion of
   dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone
   (DHT) and oestradiol (E) as biological markers in response to illegal
   administration of testosterone, 19-nortestosterone (N) and oestradiol,
   either alone or in combination. Twenty male Friesian calves (age 13-14
   months) were allotted to a control group (n=5), and five experimental
   groups (n=3) each. Each experimental animal was repeatedly injected with
   one of the following hormonal treatments: E, T, N, T+E and N+E.
   Circulating DHEA, T, DHT and E were determined by radioimmunoassay. The
   administration of T alone did not induce any variation in plasma DHEA,
   T, DHT and E, which were similar to those in the control group. In
   contrast, DHEA, T and DHT were on average significantly lower in the T+E
   and N-treated groups (p<0.01), whereas the administration of N+E
   resulted in the reduction of plasma T and DHT without any modification
   of plasma DHEA. The administration of E alone or in combination
   increased circulating levels of E but did not affect androgen plasma
   profiles. The results indicate that plasma levels of T do not permit
   detection of illegal treatments because plasma androgens always remained
   within the physiological range. Illegal E treatment could be detected in
   blood samples when they were collected at least every 20 days.}},

Abstract = {{A trial was performed to establish whether turkeys vaccinated against
   avian influenza with a vaccine containing a strain with a heterologous
   neuraminidase to the challenge virus required a higher infectious dose
   to develop infection than naive birds. Birds were vaccinated with a
   commercially available, inactivated oil emulsion product containing the
   strain A/ty/Italy/99/(H7N1) and challenged with different dilutions of a
   LPAI isolate A/ty/Italy/8000/02(H7N3) obtained during the 2002 to 2003
   Italian epidemic. Groups of 10 vaccinated and 10 unvaccinated birds.
   were infected experimentally with a virus suspension containing 10(2,)
   10(4) and 10(6) median embryo infective dose (EID50)/0.1 ml. Infected
   birds were observed daily with tracheal and cloacal swabs collected at
   regular intervals for antigen detection, virus isolation and real-time
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Pre-infection and
   post-infection serology was also performed. The results of the
   experiment indicate that infection is achieved in naive birds with 10(4)
   EID50, while vaccinated birds are resistant at this challenge dose.
   Vaccinated and unvaccinated birds were susceptible to infection with
   10(6) EID50, although the duration and/or the number of birds shedding
   was reduced in the vaccinated group. The data presented indicate that
   heterologous vaccination in the framework of a `Differentiating Infected
   from Vaccinated Animals' strategy can be a valid tool to support
   eradication measures in areas with high densities of susceptible

   to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was mainly found in isolates of swine

Abstract = {{From 1997 to 2003, Italy has been affected by two epidemics of highly
   pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and by several outbreaks of low
   pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). In 1999-2000 a severe HPAI epidemic
   affected the country, causing 413 outbreaks: a total of about 16 million
   birds died or were stamped out. From August 2000 to March 2001, a H7N1
   LPAI strain infected 78 poultry farms. The last affected flock was
   stamped out on the 2611 of March 2001. In October 2002, another LPAI
   virus of the H7N3 subtype emerged and infected a total of 388 poultry
   holdings. Eradication measures were based on stamping out or controlled
   marketing of slaughtered birds on infected farms and on the prohibition
   of restocking. Restriction measures on the movement of live poultry,
   vehicles and staff were also imposed. To supplement these disease
   control measures, two emergency vaccination programmes, based on the
   ``DIVA{''} (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy
   were implemented. The two vaccination campaigns (2000-2002 and
   2002-2003) both resulted in the eradication of infection. However, the
   first campaign appeared to be more successful that the second and
   possible explanations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reports on the development, validation and field
   application of a control strategy for avian influenza infections in
   poultry. The ``DIVA{''} (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated
   Animals) strategy is based on the use of an inactivated oil emulsion
   vaccine containing the same haemagglutinin (H) subtype as the challenge
   virus, but a different neuraminidase (N). The possibility of using the
   heterologous N subtype, to differentiate between vaccinated and
   naturally infected birds, was investigated through the development of an
   ``ad hoc{''} serological test based on the detection of specific anti-N
   antibodies. This test is based on an indirect fluorescent antibody
   assay, using as an antigen a baculovirus expressing recombinant N
   proteins.
   The vaccination strategy has been tested in the laboratory and shown to
   be efficacious both against challenge with highly pathogenic Al viruses
   and with low pathogenicity Al viruses, ensuring clinical protection,
   reduction of duration and titre of shedding. In addition, vaccination
   resulted in an increased resistance to infection.
   The companion diagnostic tests directed to the detection of anti-N1 and
   anti-N3 antibodies have been validated in the laboratory and using field
   samples. The serological assay showed an ``almost perfect agreement{''}
   (Kappa value) with the HI test, with relative sensitivity and
   specificity values of 98.1 and 95.7, respectively. The results of the
   present investigation suggest that the ``DIVA{''} control strategy may
   represent a tool to support the eradication of avian influenza
   infections in poultry.}},

Abstract = {{Among avian influenza viruses and avian paramyxoviruses are the
   aetiological agents of two of the most devastating diseases of the
   animal kingdom: (i) the highly pathogenic form of avian influenza,
   caused by some viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes, and (ii) Newcastle
   disease, caused by virulent strains of APMV type 1. Mortality rates due
   to these agents can exceed 50\% in naive bird populations, and, for some
   strains of AI, nearly 100\%. These viruses may also be responsible for
   clinical conditions in humans. The virus responsible for Newcastle
   disease has been known to cause conjunctivitis in humans since the
   1940s. The conjunctivitis is self-limiting and does not have any
   permanent consequences. Until 1997, reports of human infection with
   avian influenza viruses were sporadic and frequently associated with
   conjunctivitis. Recently, however, avian influenza virus infections have
   been associated with fatalities in human beings. These casualties have
   highlighted the potential risk that this type of infection poses to
   public health. In particular, the pathogenetic mechanisms of highly
   pathogenic avian influenza viruses in birds and the possibility of
   reassortment between avian and human viruses in the human host represent
   serious threats to human health. For this reason, any suspected case
   should be investigated thoroughly.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reviews the worldwide situation regarding avian
   influenza (AI) infections caused by viruses of the H5 and H7 subtype in
   poultry from 1999 to date. The increase in the number of primary
   introductions and the scientific data available on the molecular basis
   of pathogenicity have generated concerns particularly for legislative
   purposes, for international trade and on novel control strategies,
   including vaccination. This has led to a new proposed definition of
   ``avian influenza{''} to extend to all infections caused by H5 and H7
   viruses regardless of their virulence as notifiable diseases, although
   this has encountered some difficulties in being approved. Reference is
   also made to the zoonotic aspects of avian influenza which until 1997
   were considered to be of limited relevance in human medicine, and have
   now gained importance, both for illness and fatalities which have
   occurred following natural infection with avian viruses, and for the
   potential of generating a reassortant virus which could give rise to the
   next human influenza pandemic. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We investigated tilmicosin (TIM) metabolism, at 25, 50 or 100 muM, in
   cultures of primary hepatocytes from rabbits bred commercially for food
   and in liver microsomes prepared from both untreated and rifampicin
   (RIF)-treated rabbits. RIF is a well-known cytochrome P4503A (CYP 3A)
   inducer in rabbits and most macrolides are known to be substrates of CYP
   3A.
   No peaks in addition to those of the cis and tracts forms of TIM were
   observed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in extracts of
   microsomes from untreated rabbits. When TIM was incubated with induced
   microsomes, at least two peaks were found by HPLC and an additional
   peak, eluting at shorter retention time was isolated from hepatocytes
   incubated for 24 h with the macrolide.
   The structures of the metabolites were then estimated by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in concentrated extracts from
   induced microsomes. Five metabolites were separated and putatively
   identified: cis and trans demethylated tilmicosin, tilmicosin N-oxide
   and cis and trans tilmicosin epoxide. The overall amount of metabolites
   produced in vitro using livers of untreated and RIF treated rabbits was
   very low, has also been observed in vivo and in vitro in cattle,
   chickens and pigs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The genotype of the host plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of
   transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In this respect, the
   most important factor is represented by the gene of the prion protein
   (PrP). The present work summarizes the currently available knowledge on
   the genetic basis of TSEs focusing, in particular, on sheep scrapie.
   Interest in this disease has grown markedly following the discovery of
   bovine spongiform encephalopathy, both for scientific and health
   reasons. In Italy, specific research grants from the Ministry of Health
   and the National Research Council (CNR), together with cooperation
   between the Istituto Superiore di Sanit and the Istituti Zooprofilattici
   Sperimentali, have allowed us to study the PrP genotype and to
   investigate the genetic susceptibility to scrapie in the most important
   Italian sheep breeds, with special reference to Sarda, Comisana and
   Massese. The PrP genotype in relation to scrapie susceptibility was also
   studied in goats of lonica breed.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen fibrosarcomas, surgically excised from presumed sites of
   injection in dogs, and 10 canine fibrosarcomas excised from sites not
   used for injection were histologically and immuno-histochemically
   compared with 20 feline post-vaccinal fibrosarcomas. Canine
   fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites were of grade 1 (3), of
   grade 11 (4) and grade 111 (8). Two fibrosarcomas from non-injection
   sites were of grade I, four of grade II and four of grade III. Feline
   samples were classified as grade 1 (2), grade 11 (4) and grade 111 (14).
   All fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites of both species showed
   lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration located at the tumour periphery,
   while two canine fibrosarcomas from non-injection sites showed
   perivascular inflammatory infiltration within the neoplasm. All samples
   were immunohistochemically examined for vimentin, smooth muscle actin,
   muscle specific actin and desmin expression. All tumours were positive
   for vimentin. Ten canine fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites and
   all feline samples contained cells consistent with a myofibroblastic
   immunophenotype. Aluminium deposits were detected in eight canine
   fibrosarcomas from presumed injection sites and 11 feline post-vaccinal
   fibrosarcomas by the aurintricarboxylic acid method. The present study
   identifies distinct similarities between canine fibrosarcomas from
   presumed injection sites and feline post-vaccinal fibrosarcomas,
   suggesting the possibility of the development of post-injection sarcomas
   not only in cats, but also in dogs.}},

Abstract = {{A herpesvirus was isolated during 2 occurrences of mass mortality among
   adult catfish Ictalurus melas raised in different farms in northern
   Italy. The agent replicated in the channel catfish ovary (CCO) cell line
   from channel catfish I. punctatus, inducing a cytopathic effect similar
   to that caused by Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 (also referred to as channel
   catfish herpesvirus, CCV). The new herpesvirus, designated I. melas
   herpesvirus (IcmHV) did not react with polyclonal rabbit or monoclonal
   antibodies directed to CCV in either neutralization or indirect
   immunofluorescence assays. The virions of IcmHV possessed a hexagonal
   nucleocapsid of 107 nm in diameter surrounded by an envelope with a
   diameter of 227 nm (n = 20) typical for members of the family
   Herpesviridae. Virions of IcmHV purified from infected CCO cells
   contained 17 polypeptides ranging in size from 17.5 to 175 kDa and most
   differed in molecular weight from those found for CCV. The IcmHV was
   also distinct from CCV when compared by restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms (RFLP) of genomic DNA following digestions with the
   endonucleases Kpn I and Sac I. Lastly, the virulence of IcmHV for
   channel catfish fry and juveniles, respectively, was demonstrated by
   experimental infections induced by bath exposure or intraperitoneal
   injection that resulted in 78 to 96\% cumulative mortality in groups of
   exposed fish. Preventing the introduction of this agent into geographic
   regions where significant channel catfish production occurs should be a
   high priority.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper reports of the development and validation of a control
   strategy for avian influenza infections in poultry. The ``DIVA{''}
   (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy is based on
   the use of an inactivated oil emulsion vaccine containing the same
   haemagglutinin (H) subtype as the challenge virus, but a different
   neuraminidase (N). The possibility of using the heterologous N subtype,
   to differentiate between vaccinated and naturally infected birds, was
   investigated through the development of an ``ad hoc{''} serological test
   based on the detection of specific anti-N1 antibodies. This was achieved
   using a baculovirus expressing a recombinant N1 protein. The
   A/ck/Pakistan/H7N3 virus was used as a vaccine and birds were challenged
   with the HPAI A/ty/Italy/4580/V99/H7N1 strain. The homologous H group
   ensured a clinical protection of 93\% regardless of the vaccination
   scheme used, and was able to prevent viraemia and muscle colonization in
   the clinically healthy challenged birds. However, it was not able to
   prevent viral shedding. The ``ad hoc{''} serological assay was developed
   as an indirect immunofluorescence test, and was validated using 608
   field sera, and showed an ``almost perfect agreement{''} (Kappa value)
   with the HI test, with relative sensitivity and specificity values of

Abstract = {{Eurasian collared doves (Streptopelia decaocto) are thought to originate
   from India and they have colonized, throughout the centuries, the Middle
   East and, more recently, Mediterranean countries such as Italy and
   Spain. In the present paper we report of the isolation and
   characterization of Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) obtained from
   Eurasian collared doves during 2000-2001, and compare them to isolates
   obtained from feral pigeons (Columba livia) during the same period. All
   isolates could be classified as avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV1) and
   belonged to the pigeon variant group (PPMV1), as their haemagglutinating
   activity was inhibited by mAb 161/617 which is specific for PPMV1. The
   intracerebral pathogenicity indices ranged from 0.68 to 1.38 and all
   isolates contained multiple basic amino acids at the deduced cleavage
   site of the fusion protein, which is a typical feature of virulent
   viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates indicate that 18/20 of
   these form a separate cluster from the isolates obtained from pigeons in
   the same period. These findings suggest that different lineages are
   circulating in feral pigeon populations, and that a separate lineage
   affects Eurasian collared doves.}},

   virus of the H5N2 subtype and was limited to eight premises in backyard
   and semi-intensive flocks. The prompt identification of the disease was
   followed by the implementation of European Union (EU) directive
   92/40/EEC and resulted in the eradication of infection without serious
   consequences to the poultry industry. The 1999-00 epidemic was caused by
   a virus of the H7N1 subtype that originated from the mutation of a low
   pathogenic virus and resulted instead in a devastating epidemic that
   affected industrially reared poultry, culminating in the infection of
   413 flocks. The description of the epidemics and the result of the
   control policies are reported.}},

   low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI), caused by a H7N1 type A
   influenza virus, affected the intensively reared poultry population of
   Northeastern Italy. A total of 199 flocks were diagnosed with influenza
   infection. The highest number affected flocks were in meat turkeys
   (164), with only a limited number of turkey breeder, chicken (breeders,
   broilers, and table egg layers), and guinea fowl flocks infected.
   Following the circulation of the LPAI virus in a susceptible population
   for several months, a high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus
   emerged. Over 13 million birds on 413 different premises were affected
   by the HPAI virus, including turkey, chicken, guinea fowl, pheasant,
   Japanese quail, ostrich, and waterfowl flocks. In the present paper we
   report on the clinical, gross, histopathological, and

Abstract = {{In 1999-2000, Italy was affected by the most severe avian influenza (AI)
   epidemic that has ever occurred in Europe. The epidemic was caused by a
   type A influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype, which originated from the
   mutation of a low-pathogenicity (LP) AI virus of the same subtype. From
   August to November 2000, 4 months after the eradication of the highly
   pathogenic (HP) AI virus, the LPAI strain re-emerged and infected 55
   poultry farms mainly located in the southern area of Verona province
   (Veneto region). To supplement disease control measures already in
   force, an emergency vaccination program against the disease was
   implemented in the area. Vaccination was carried out using an
   inactivated heterologous vaccine (A/chicken/Pakistan/1995-H7N3). In
   order to establish whether LPAI infection was circulating in the area,
   regular serological testing of sentinel birds in vaccinated flocks and a
   discriminatory test able to distinguish the different types of
   antineuraminidase antibodies (anti-N1 and anti-N3) were performed.
   Shortly after the beginning of the vaccination campaign (December 2000
   to March 2001), the H7N1 LPAI virus emerged again, infecting 23 farms.
   Among these, only one vaccinated flock was affected, and infection did
   not spread further to other vaccinated farms. The data reported in the
   present paper indicate that the combination of biosecurity measures,
   official control, and vaccination can be considered successful for the
   control of LPAI infections in densely populated poultry areas.}},

Abstract = {{Recent epidemics of highly contagious animal diseases included in list A
   of the Office International des Epizooties, such as foot-and-mouth
   disease, classical swine fever and avian influenza (AI), have led to the
   implementation of stamping-out policies resulting in the depopulation of
   millions of animals. The enforcement of a control strategy based on
   culling animals that are infected, suspected of being infected or
   suspected of being contaminated, which is based only on the application
   of sanitary restrictions on farms, may not be sufficient to avoid the
   spread of infection, particularly in areas that have high animal
   densities, thus resulting in mass depopulation. In the European Union,
   the directive that imposes the enforcement of a stamping-out policy
   (92/40/EC) for AI was adopted in 1992 but was drafted in the 1980s. The
   poultry industry has undergone substantial changes in the past 20 years,
   mainly resulting in shorter production cycles and in higher animal
   densities per territorial unit. Due to these organizational changes,
   infectious diseases are significantly more difficult to control because
   of the greater number of susceptible animals reared per given unit of
   time and due to the difficulties in applying adequate biosecurity
   measures. The slaughter and destruction of great numbers of animals is
   also questionable from an ethical point of view, particularly when human
   health implications are negligible. For this reason, mass depopulation
   has raised serious concerns for the general public and has recently led
   to very high costs and economic losses for national and federal
   governments, stakeholders and, ultimately, for consumers. In the past,
   the use of vaccines in such emergencies has been limited by the
   impossibility of differentiating vaccinated/infected from
   vaccinated/non-infected animals. The major concern was that through
   trade or movement of apparently uninfected animals or products, the
   disease could spread further or might be exported to other countries.
   For this reason, export bans have been imposed on countries enforcing a
   vaccination policy. This review considers the possible strategies for
   the control of avian influenza infections, bearing in mind the new
   proposed definition of AI, including the advantages and disadvantages of
   using conventional inactivated (homologous and heterologous) vaccines
   and recombinant vaccines. Reference is made to the different control
   strategies, including the restriction measures to be applied in case of
   the enforcement of a vaccination policy. In addition, the implications
   of a vaccination policy on trade are discussed. It is concluded that if
   vaccination is accepted as an option for the control of AI, vaccine
   banks, including companion diagnostic tests, must be established and
   made available for immediate use.}},

Pages = {{243-253}},
Abstract = {{Growth performance, behaviour, cleanliness, carcass traits and meat
   quality of 48 Simmental young bulls housed on slatted floor or on straw
   bedding with the same space allowance were compared in the study, which
   lasted 250 days. The animals (initial body weight = 321.2 +/- 34.1 kg)
   were assigned to 8 balanced groups, according to their initial body
   weight. All the groups were reared in separate pens with a space
   allowance of 3 m(2)/head. Four pens had a concrete floor covered with a
   straw bedding while the other pens had a fully slatted floor made of
   concrete slats. All the animals received the same diet provided ad
   libitum.
   Type of floor did not affect the bulls' daily gain, feed intake and feed
   efficiency. Health status of the animals was satisfactory throughout the
   trial and several blood indicators of chronic stress were not modified
   by the treatment. Behavioural observations carried out at d 10, 80, 180
   and 240 showed differences only on some behaviours due to the type of
   floor. In particular, the straw bedding increased eating behaviour and
   it encouraged the simultaneous presence of more bulls at the manger.
   Regardless of the type of floor, the progress of the trial showed a
   linear increase of animals' inactivity (P < 0.05) while linear decrease
   of bulls' lying (P < 0.01), eating (P < 0.001) and ruminating (P < 0.01)
   was observed. These results can be referred to the growth of the animal
   body frame, which made the space allowance progressively limiting. In
   the straw bedded pens, clean straw was added weekly and fully renewed
   every 3 weeks, but this bedding management did not allow a satisfactory
   cleanliness of the animals in comparison with the slatted floor.
   However, the worse cleanliness of the bulls on the straw did not promote
   their grooming activity. Young bulls were slaughtered at a final weight
   of 614.6 +/- 14.7 kg and their carcass traits and meat quality were not
   affected by the treatment.
   The straw bedded system cannot always be considered the cleanest
   solution for the housing of beef cattle and its frequent renewal must be
   carried out, particularly when animals are kept with a minimum space
   allowance. The minimal differences observed for all the parameters
   measured in the study between the two types of floors must be related to
   the adoption of the same space allowance/animal and this factor has
   shown to be the most critical housing parameter affecting beef cattle
   welfare during the fattening period.}},

Abstract = {{From November 2000 to December 2001 a serological monitoring programme
   for paratuberculosis was carried out in 419 dairy farms in the Veneto
   Region. Blood samples were tested using a commercially available ELISA
   (Herdcheck, IDEXX). The sensitivity and specificity values of the test
   were respectively 45 \% and 99 \%. Out of 27135 tested animals 3,50 \%
   (CI 95 \% = 3,28-3,72) reacted positively. If all farms with at least
   one positive animal were considered as positive, a high (65 \%) apparent
   farm prevalence would be obtained. However, the probability of false
   positive reactions, which could increase with farm size, should be taken
   into account. These false positive results could determine a
   misclassification of some non-infected herds.
   Data obtained in the present study suggest that the apparent farm
   prevalence should be corrected and reduced in order to get near to the
   true value. It appears reasonable to define for each farm, a cut-off
   value (number of positive animals) to classify the farm as positive, so
   that herd-level specificity does not drop below 95 \%. If the latter key
   were applied, the farm prevalence would be reduced from 65 \% to 27 \%.
   However, the hypothesis that this approach gives a more accurate
   measurement of the presence of the infection should be confirmed by a
   specific study coupling serological and bacteriological examinations.}},

   application of tandem mass spectrometry (MS) fragmentation to a stable,
   well characterized negative ion produced by chemical ionization (methane
   as reagent gas). A specific derivatizing reactant is employed
   (pentafluorobenzyl bromide), combined with
   bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, to favor the formation of a
   diagnostic precursor negative ion. Plasma samples are purified through a
   C18 solid phase extraction column and derivatized before gas
   chromatography-MS analysis. The accuracy and the precision of the
   method, tested over a set of spiked samples, were satisfactory. The
   limit of detection was found to be 5 pg ml(-1) and the limit of
   quantification was fixed at 20 pg ml-1. The fragmentation pattern is
   fully explained and the method is applicable for the official analysis
   of bovine plasma for the detection of 17beta-estradiol according to the

   the mass was located just beneath the conjunctival epithelium,
   suggesting that the conjunctiva was the tissue of origin. The tumor
   showed high cellularity and was composed of pleomorphic spindle and
   polygonal cells arranged in interlacing bundles and solid sheets. The
   presence of slit-like spaces between tumor cells containing erythrocytes
   demonstrated the vascular differentiation. Mitotic activity was
   moderate, but atypical mitoses were detected. The surgical area healed
   uneventfully and after 7 months there was no recurrence. To the authors'
   knowledge, this is the first report of conjunctival hemangiosarcoma of
   the third eyelid in a cat.}},

   groups of 69 Polish Friesian calves, balanced according to initial BW,
   were assigned to two water treatmenst in a 3 x 2 x 2 factorial
   arrangement that provided solid feed in addition to the milk-replacer
   diet (No solid feed, 250 g-calf(-1).d(-1) of wheat straw or the same
   amount of beet pulp), and the adoption of two housing systems
   (individual stall vs group pen), The fattening trial lasted 160 d, and
   calves received drinking water starting from the 2nd wk of the study.
   The amount of drinking water was progressively increased from 3 to 8
   L.calf(-1).d(-1). Although not dehydrated, as shown by hematocrit and
   Na, K, and total protein hemoconcentration, calves consumed almost all
   the offered amount of water throughout the fattening period. Therefore,
   the water provided by the milk replacer alone, which ranged between 6 to
   16 L.calf.d(-1), was not sufficient to satisfy the need of the animal.
   Drinking water did not affect the calves' growth performance but it
   reduced nonnutritive oral behavior throughout the fattening period.
   Based on these results, drinking water did not cover a shortage in the
   calves' water requirement but it played a role in environmental
   enrichment. Health status was similar between treatments, although water
   provision reduced the episodes of feed refusal. The measurement of
   chronic stress by ACTH challenge showed that the administration of
   drinking water would be advisable when calves are fed with small amounts
   of solid feed for well-being. Feces consistency and animal cleanliness
   were not affected by drinking water. At slaughter, forestomach
   development was similar between treatments, and drinking water did not
   affect the number of calves showing rumen hairballs and abomasal
   lesions. No differences in color and other meat quality traits were
   observed between Water and No Water calves. Despite the lack of direct
   effects on productive traits, when water was available, the calves drank
   it, and positive effects were noticed on their nonnutritive oral
   behaviors and chronic stress indicators.}},

   to different extents in the respiratory tract of the developing mallard

Abstract = {{Natural infections with influenza A viruses have been reported in a
   variety of animal species including humans, pigs, horses, sea mammals,
   mustelids and birds. Occasionally devastating pandemics occur in humans.
   Although viruses of relatively few HA and NA subtype combinations have
   been isolated from mammalian species, all 15 HA subtypes and all 9 NA
   subtypes, in most combinations, have been isolated from birds.
   In the 20th century the sudden emergence of antigenically different
   strains transmissible in humans, termed antigenic shift, has occurred on
   four occasions, 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), 1968 (H3N2) and 1977 (H1N1),
   each time resulting in a pandemic. Genetic analysis of the isolates
   demonstrated that `new' strains most certainly emerged after
   reassortment of genes of viruses of avian and human origin in a
   permissive host. The leading theory is that the pig represents the
   `mixing vessel' where this genetic reassortment may occur.
   In 1996, an H7N7 influenza virus of avian origin was isolated from a
   woman with a self-limiting conjunctivitis. During 1997 in Hong Kong, an
   H5N1 avian influenza virus was recognised as the cause of death of 6 of
   18 infected patients. Genetic analysis revealed these human isolates of
   H5N1 subtype to be indistinguishable from a highly pathogenic avian
   influenza virus that was endemic in the local poultry population. More
   recently, in March 1999, two independent isolations of influenza virus
   subtype H9N2 were made from girls aged one to four who recovered from
   flu-like illnesses in Hong Kong. Subsequently, five isolations of H9N2
   virus from humans on mainland China in August 1998 were reported. H9N2
   viruses were known to be widespread in poultry in China and other Asian
   countries.
   In all these cases there was no evidence of human to human spread except
   with the H5N1 infections where there was evidence of very limited
   spread. This is in keeping with the finding that all these viruses
   possessed all eight genes of avian origin. It may well be that infection
   of humans with avian influenza viruses occurs much more frequently than
   originally assumed, but due to their limited effect go unrecognised.
   For the human population as a whole the main danger of direct infection
   with avian influenza viruses appears to be if people infected with an
   `avian' virus are infected simultaneously with a `human' influenza
   virus. In such circumstances reassortment could occur with the potential
   emergence of a virus fully capable of spread in the human population,
   but with antigenic characteristics for which the human population was
   immunologically naive. Presumably this represents a very rare
   coincidence, but one which could result in a true influenza pandemic.

Abstract = {{From the end of March to the beginning of December 1999, 199 outbreaks
   of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) were diagnosed in the Veneto
   and Lombardia regions, which are located in the northern part of Italy.
   The virus responsible for the epidemic was characterized as a type A
   influenza virus of the H7N1 subtype of low pathogenicity. On the 17th of
   December, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was diagnosed in a
   meat turkey flock in which 100\% mortality was observed in 72 It. The
   infection spread to the industrial poultry population of northern Italy
   including chickens, guinea-fowl, quail, pheasants, ducks and ostriches
   for a total of 413 outbreaks. Over 13 million birds were affected by the
   epidemic, which caused dramatic economic losses to the Italian poultry
   industry with severe social and economic implications. The possibility
   of H7 virus transmission to humans in close contact with the outbreaks
   was evaluated through a serological survey. Seven hundred and fifty nine
   sera were collected and tested for the detection of anti-H7 antibodies
   by means of the micro-neutralization (MN) and single radial haemolysis
   (SRH) tests. All samples resulted negative. A limited number of clinical
   samples were also collected for attempted virus isolation with negative
   results. Current European legislation considers LPAI and HPAI as two
   completely distinct diseases, not contemplating any compulsory
   eradication policy for LPAI and requiring eradication for HPAI. Evidence
   collected during the Italian 1999-2000 epidemic indicates that LPAI due
   to viruses of the H7 subtype may mutate to HPAI, and, therefore, LPAI
   caused by viruses of the H5 or H7 subtypes must be controlled to avoid
   the emergence of HPAI. A reconsideration of the current definition of
   avian influenza adopted by the EU, could possibly be an aid to avoiding
   devastating epidemics for the poultry industry in Member States. (C)

   different avian species were susceptible to different degrees. Chickens
   and guinea fowl appeared to be the most susceptible, followed by
   pheasants, turkeys and ostriches. The epidemiological inquiry

Abstract = {{Two different feeding plans for veal calves were compared in the study:
   a traditional liquid diet supplemented with 250 g/calf/d of barley grain
   or with 250 g/calf/d of ground wheat straw. The two solid feeds had
   different chemical composition but a similar particle size obtained by
   grinding the straw in a mill with an 8-mm mesh screen. Twenty-four
   Polish Friesian male calves were used in the study and they were housed
   in individual wooden stalls (0.83 x 1.80 m). The health status of all
   the calves was satisfactory for the entire fattening period and no
   specific medical treatment was required during the trial. Calves fed
   wheat straw showed a greater intake of solid feed (196 vs. 139 g/d;
   P<0.01) and a higher average daily gain (1288 vs. 1203 g/d; P<0.05) than
   those receiving barley grain. The consumption of milk replacer was not
   affected by the type of solid feed and no milk refusal episodes were

   the two feeding treatments despite the higher iron intake provided by
   the wheat straw throughout the fattening period (2.12 vs. 1.15 g;

   frequency of oral stereotypies at the end of the fattening period. At
   the slaughterhouse, no differences were observed between the feeding
   treatments as regards carcass weight and dressing percentage. The calves
   fed ground wheat straw had a heavier weight of the empty omasum (518 vs.
   341 g; P<0.01) whereas the empty weight of the reticulorumen and
   abomasum were similar to those of calves fed barley grain. The incidence
   of abomasal erosions, ulcers and scars was similar in both treatments;
   however the index of abomasal damage, which considers the number and the
   seriousness of different type of lesions, was higher in calves receiving
   barley grain. Therefore, the grinding of straw particles, as opposed to
   barley grain, can reduce the abrasiveness of roughage at the abomasum
   level. Visual evaluation of the carcass colour and instrumental
   measurement of meat colour did not show significant differences between
   diets. The study confirmed that in the veal calf, carcass and meat
   colour are not strictly correlated with the iron intake from solid
   feeds.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-two Newcastle disease virus isolates from the 2000 Italian

   nucleotide sequencing of approximately 400 base pairs of the fusion

   assessed by means of the intracerebral pathogenicity test ( ICPI). The
   strains tested exhibited an ICPI ranging from 1.6 to 2.0. On the basis
   of the monoclonal antibody binding pattern, all isolates could be
   classified as belonging to group C1. Both monoclonal antibody and
   genomic analysis revealed a very high degree of homology, indicating a
   common source of infection. On the basis of the phylogenetic analysis,
   it appears that the Italian isolates are closely related to the recent
   isolates from the UK, Scandinavia and South East Europe, thus suggesting
   the circulation of this viral strain in Europe during the past 5 years.}},

Abstract = {{A field survey was performed in a heifer raising operation in Northern
   Italy to study the introduction, maintenance and dissemination of
   Escherichia toll O157 in the herd and to identify possible control
   measures at the farm level. Rectal swabs from two different groups of
   animals (surveys 1 and 2) were tested for E. coli O157 by an
   immunomagnetic separation technique. In survey 1, a group of female
   calves (341 animals initially) introduced from 30 dairy herds during
   April 1996 to March 1997 were tested for E. coli O157 on arrival from
   the original herd when housed in individual hutches. 2-3 days after
   completion of weaning (which was associated with grouping) and 2 months
   after weaning. No statistically significant difference between excretion
   rates (3.8\%, 4.2\%, 4.4\%, respectively) was found. Calves from which
   E. coli O157 was isolated on arrival came from 6 of the 30 dairy herds.
   Strains isolated during survey 1 belonged to seven different pulsed
   field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. In survey 2, a group of young
   animals aged. at the beginning of the study. between 2 1/2 and 7 1/2
   months (median = 124 days) was rested monthly for E. coli O157 for 11-15
   months from May 1996 to July 1997. The group included 92 animals for 11
   months and then gradually decreased to 59 animals. overall, E. coli
   O157, belonging to six different PFGE profiles. were isolated from 138
   (10.7\%) of 1293 rectal swabs. Monthly excretion rates ranged from 2.7\%
   to 23.7\%. with summer peaks in both years. Fifty-nine (64.1\%) of the
   92 heifers were positive at least once: of these 59 animals, 21,
   (37.3\%) were positive on only one occasion, 23 (39\%) were positive on
   two occasions and 14 (23.7\%) were positive on three or mon occasions.
   From two heifers positive on 9 out of the 15 sampling visits, strains
   with the same PFGE profile were isolated, respectively, on seven and
   eight occasions while strains with only one band difference were
   isolated on the remaining occasions. E. coli O157 was also isolated from
   6 of 16 samples of bedding, two of two samples of slurry and one of five
   samples from water troughs collected during survey. (C) 2001 Elsevier

   region of the neuraminidase (NA) for viruses from the outbreaks. The
   HPAI viruses have an unusual multibasic haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage

   Additional glycosylation sites were present, at amino acid position 149

   glycosylation sites. All viruses examined from the Italian outbreaks had
   a 22 amino acid deletion in the NA stalk that is not present in the N1
   genes of the wild bird viruses examined. We conclude that the Italian
   HPAI viruses arose from low pathogenicity strains, and that a deletion
   in the NA stalk followed by the acquisition of additional glycosylation
   near the receptor binding site of HA1 may be an adaptation of H7 viruses
   to a new host species i.e. domestic poultry.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical fish importation from countries outside the European Union or
   `third countries' principally in Asia, presents a potential risk of
   introducing both human and fish pathogens. There has been concern that
   present an animal disease risk, particularly since there have been
   several major outbreaks of this may re epidemic cholera in South-East
   Asia and South America. Thus, since 1990, the Ministry of Health in
   Italy has supported research on the possible presence of Vibrio cholerae
   and Salmonella spp. in the aquarium water of fish imported from third
   countries.
   During 1997 to 1998, the authors examined 420 filtered water samples,
   using selective media. All the suspected strains isolated were
   biochemically and serologically identified. Serological identification
   was conducted using polyvalent and monovalent sera. As a result, 34
   samples (8.09\%),gave positive results for the presence of non-01 Vibrio
   cholerae, also called non-agglutinating (NAG) Vibrio. Although these
   bacteria do not cause epidemic cholera, their enterotoxins could be
   responsible for gastro-enteritis in human beings. This is considered as
   a potential risk for aquarium operators and tropical fish hobbyists, as
   well as being potentially responsible for some disease outbreaks in
   fish. In addition, 10 samples (2.38\%) showed positive results for the
   presence of Salmonella spp. (2 samples of S. Enteritidis, 2 of S.
   Typhimurium, 2 of S. Blockley, 2 of S. Newport, 1 of S. Hadar and 1 of
   S. Derby). This seems to increase the potential risk for human and
   aquatic animal health.
   This study provides on an example of certain pathogenic adverse
   consequences. There are other additional bacterial pathogens (i.e. V.
   vulnificus and Mycobacterium marinum) which could also cause severe
   disease in humans and animals. To assist in obtaining an accurate risk
   analysis for disease control measures, a two-year research project on
   bacterial and parasitic diseases of tropical fish imported from third
   countries is currently in progress, with the collaboration of the
   Italian National Health Service and tropical fish importers.
   The authors emphasise the importance of involving other research centres
   in a monitoring programme to deal with import risk analysis of aquatic
   organisms.}},

Abstract = {{From the end of March to the beginning of December 1999, an epidemic of
   low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) affected the industrial poultry
   population of northern Italy. The virus responsible for the epidemic was
   subtyped as H7N1 with an intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of 0.0,
   and a deduced amino acid sequence of the region coding for the cleavage
   site of the haemagglutinin molecule typical of low pathogenicity
   viruses. The circulation of the virus in a susceptible population for
   several months caused the emergence of a highly pathogenic virus with an
   IVPI of 3.0 and the presence of multiple basic amino acids in the

   molecule. Over 13 million birds were affected by the epidemic and, in
   the present paper, we report the results of the clinical, virological
   and histopathological investigations performed on affected chickens and
   turkeys. Clinical, gross and microscopic lesions caused by LPAI were
   more severe in turkeys than in chickens, while highly pathogenicity
   avian influenza (HPAI) caused similar mortality rates in both species.
   Current European legislation considers LPAI and HPAI as two completely
   distinct diseases, not requiring any compulsory eradication policy for
   LPAI but enforcing eradication for HPAI. In the Italian 1999 to 2000
   epidemic, LPAI mutated to HPAI in a densely populated area, causing
   great economic losses. A reconsideration of the current European Union
   legislation on avian influenza, including LPAI of the H5 and H7
   subtypes, could possibly be an aid to avoiding devastating epidemics for
   the poultry industry.}},

   ruckeri O1 strains had similar profiles, as demonstrated by all three

   The strains of P. damsela subsp. piscicida showed similar profiles when
   tested with ribotyping and PFGE; however, two slightly different
   profiles were distinguished by IRS-PCR using the primer ERIC2. The two
   profiles appeared to be related to the geographic origin of the strains,
   since each of them was specific to isolates from a certain area (i.e.

   fingerprinting may be a valuable tool in typing fish bacterial
   pathogens, which often present a great degree of genetic homogeneity.

Abstract = {{During 1999, northern Italy has been affected by an epidemic of low
   pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) caused by a virus of the H7N1
   subtype. Due to the characteristics of the poultry industry in the area
   and to the absence of specific legislative tools to eradicate infection,
   the virus continued to circulate for several months until a highly
   pathogenic virus of the same subtype emerged. The highly pathogenic
   virus had caused death, at the time of writing, of over 13 million birds
   in 3 months. The consequences of the highly pathogenic avian influenza
   (HPAI) epidemic appear to be devastating for the poultry industry and
   the social community.
   Several conditions generated the current situation, including the high
   density of susceptible animals and the structure of the poultry industry
   in the infected area. In addition, the circulation of LPAI virus for a
   number of months inevitably delayed the prompt identification of HPAI
   and complicated the interpretation of diagnostic results. A
   reconsideration of current European legislation and a reorganization of
   the poultry industry are suggested to prevent the occurrence of similar
   situations in countries of the European Union.}},

   binding to anti-EHV-1 antibodies. The sequences of the amino acids

   identifying a number of potential antibody binding regions. Presumptive
   epitopes were identified within the proteins encoded by genes 7 (DNA
   helicase/primase complex protein), 11 (tegument protein), 16

   71 (envelope glycoprotein gp300), and 74 (glycoprotein E). Two groups of

   E (gE), identified type-specific epitopes which could be used to
   distinguish between sera from horses infected with either EHV-1 or EHV-4

   peptides as antigen. The gC epitope had been previously identified as an

   the gE antibody binding region had not been previously identified. This

Abstract = {{A significant percentage of rabbit does fail to become pregnant after

   procedure are related to delayed luteolysis and high progesterone
   concentrations noted to present at the time of AI. The rabbits, randomly
   assigned to 4 groups (3 animals/group), were given 0.8 mu g GnRH
   analogue (Day 0) just prior to infusing the uterus with sterile extender
   (control group) or with extender inoculated with 0.5, 1, and 2 x 10(6)
   Pasteurella multocida (treated groups). The effects of treatments on
   functional lifespan of CL were assessed by evaluating plasma
   progesterone from Day 0 to Day 23 of pseudopregnancy. In treated
   rabbits, the progesterone profiles closely overlapped those found in
   controls until approximately Day 14. Thereafter, they varied greatly
   between animals, but luteolysis was delayed by at least 5-6 d and
   developed less rapidly than in controls. On Day 21, progesterone
   concentrations were higher than normal in 4 treated does. In a field
   survey, vaginal swabs were collected at the time of the second AI from 1
   14 non-pregnant rabbits and those positive to bacteriological culture,
   were killed humanely 16 d later to collect uterine swabs. Positive
   uterine swabs were found only in 19 of the 34 does having a positive
   vaginal swabs and all of them were not pregnant. The most frequent
   pathogen isolated was S. aureus (50\%), followed by E. coli (37.5 \%)
   and P. multocida (12.5\%). We demonstrated that uterine infection
   increases the life-span of CL in non-pregnant does and that infections
   of the genital tract system are quite common among does on breeding
   farms, probably related to using AI. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy, otherwise known as fish
   encephalitis or viral nervous necrosis (VNN), is an emerging problem in
   several farmed marine fish species in various geographic areas all over
   the world. Since summer 1995, heavy losses affecting mainly juvenile and
   adult sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) have been observed in several
   on-growing facilities in Italy. Dying fish show abnormal swimming
   behaviour and, at temperatures higher than 20-22 degrees C, mortality
   rates range between 15 and 50\%. Neither significant external nor
   internal gross pathological signs, except frequent abnormal swim bladder
   hyperinflation, were detected. Histological investigations reveal
   vacuolations in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord and in the
   granular layers of the retina. Serial tissue sections examined by an
   immunohistochemical method carried out with antisera against fish
   nodaviruses showed a positive reaction. Additionally, spherical
   virus-like particles 22-25 nm in diameter were detected by electron
   microscopy in negative stained preparations of brain tissues, and the
   same samples gave a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) for the T4 region of the fish nodavirus gene. These
   results indicate that both juvenile and adult sea bass subject to mass
   mortality in Italy since summer 1995 are infected with a fish nodavirus
   and strongly suggest that the identified virus is the cause of the
   observed mortality. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

   submerged fibroblast cultures, and modulates the differentiation of
   keratinocytes in in vitro reconstructed epidermis. Compound 5 induces
   thickening of epidermis in vivo, one of the most remarkable
   pharmacological effects of retinoids on skin, but compared to all-trans

   terms of both erythema and scaling. Compound 5 could then represent a
   promising candidate for the treatment of certain dermatological

Abstract = {{The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was
   used to detect Equine Arteritis Virus (EAV) in the semen of 88 horses
   and 2 donkeys, with neutralising antibodies against EAV, on the basis of
   the amplification of a 279 bp long fragment located in the viral
   polymerase gene.
   The RT-PCR assay revealed the virus at 4 TCID50/ml in cell culture and
   showed a greater sensitivity (54.4\%) than cell culture isolation
   (33.3\%).
   Moreover, the two samples of donkey semen were found positive.
   The cDNAs obtained from 14 samples of horse and 2 of donkey semen were
   sequenced. Comparing the sequence of reference strain Bucyrus, the
   analysed samples were 78-100\% identical and showed a 84-97\% nucleotide
   identity with Bucyrus isolate.
   The results demonstrate high levels of genomic heterogeneity among the
   extracted RNAs, but inside the fragment amplified a well-preserved
   region of 24 bp was found with only three mismatches in some samples,
   suggesting that this could be ideal as a probe for RT-PCR-ELISA.
   The RT-PCR-ELISA assay using the EAV 7 and 8 primer set, has proved to
   be sensitive, specific and above all directly applicable to semen.
   Additionally, the short time needed for the overall procedure makes this
   method suitable for diagnostic purposes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This study assessed the accuracy of 16 commercial and three
   self-produced kits and drew the basis for using an external quality
   control (EQC) system. The commercial kits were mainly developed for
   blood sex steroid determination in humans but also have been used in
   cattle. Parallelism, recovery and precision tests were performed for
   progesterone (P-4), testosterone (T) and oestradiol (E-2) assays.
   Moreover, anonymous QC samples were sent to be analysed to some Italian
   laboratories, All kits showed a fair degree of parallelism (P < 0.01),
   even though 2/7 kits for T and 1/6 kits for E-2 determination showed a
   regression coefficient (r(2)) lower than 0.98. For Pq, an acceptable
   range of accuracy was achieved in the recovery test only by 1/6 kits;
   two kits showed fair or great overestimation and two kits considerable
   underestimation. For T, an acceptable range of accuracy was achieved
   only by 1/7 kits. For E-2, 4/6 kits presented a variable degree of
   underestimation and two kits showed great overestimation. Ln the
   intra-assay precision test quite good repeatability was achieved only
   using samples with high hormone concentrations. While assaying samples
   with low concentrations we found a number of RSD > 10\%. Moreover, the
   laboratories participating in the EQC produced statistically different
   (P < 0.05) results, particularly for high and medium concentrations. In
   conclusion, the use of commercial kits for screening naturally occurring
   sex steroid concentrations in cattle blood, in the case of suspected
   illegal treatments, requires preventive validation procedures and the
   development of an opportune EQC system.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic fate of 19-nortestosterone laurate in cattle was
   investigated to evaluate target analyte(s) appropriate to surveillance
   for illicit use as a growth promoting agent. Bovine hepatocytes were
   incubated with either {[}H-3] 19-nortestosterone laurate (19-NTL;
   4-estren-17 beta-laurate-3-one) or {[}H-3] 19-nortestosterone (19-NT;
   4-estren-17 beta-ol-3-one; nandrolone). Hepatocyte medium was extracted
   with solid phase Clx media and analysed by narrow bore radio-HPLC-MSn
   (LCQ, Finnigan) to evaluate the structure of metabolites of 19-NTL and
   19-NT. Radio-HPLC of hepatocyte medium extracts following incubation
   with {[}3H]19-NTL confirmed that the first step of biotransformation in
   liver was hydrolysis of the fatty acid ester to release {[}3H]19-NT,
   which, in turn, was converted into a range of metabolites of diverse
   polarity. Hydrolysis of hepatocyte medium extracts with P-glucuronidase
   (Helix pomatia) indicated that some of these metabolites were
   glucuronide or sulfate conjugates. Structural analysis of unconjugated
   metabolities by positive-ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation
   MS2 and comparison with available reference preparations indicated
   biotransformation of 19-NT to 4-estren-17 alpha-ol-3-one,
   4-estren-3,17-dione (major metabolite after 1 h), n-hydroxy-4-estren-3,
   17-dione, n-hydroxy-4-estren-17-ol-3-one, beta-estran-3 alpha-ol-17-one
   (noretiocholanolone) and 5 beta-estran-3 alpha,17 beta-ol(major
   metabolite after 4 h). Conjugated metabolites were analysed by
   electrospray ionization, which revealed the presence of glucuronide
   conjugates of alpha-(trace) and P-epimers of 19-NT,
   n-hydroxy-4-estren-3, 17-dione, n-hydroxy-4-estren-17-ol-3-one and 5
   beta-estran-3 alpha,17 beta-diol. These studies provide a clear
   indication of the route of hepatic metabolism in the bovine, which may
   now be readily substantiated by reference to samples, such as urine or
   bile, derived from animals treated with unlabelled 19-NTL.}},

Abstract = {{A fast and simple extraction procedure was developed for simultaneous
   determination in bovine liver of two veterinary dress, widely used as
   growth promoters in meat production: dexamethasone (a synthetic
   corticosteroid drug) and clenbuterol (a beta(2)-adrenergic agonist
   drug). Liver samples were extracted by acetonitrile, without any
   clean-up step. Two different ELISAs, specific for the two classes of
   drugs, were used to determine the residue concentration in the extracts.
   The intra- and inter-extraction variability was determined at different
   concentrations: the intra-extraction coefficients of variation (CT's)
   were between 2.5 and 17.7\% for dexamethasone and between 0.9 and 9.8\%
   for clenbuterol; the inter-extraction CVs were between 2.0 and 16.8\%
   for dexamethasone and between 0.5 and 10.8\% for clenbuterol. Recovery
   ranged from 92 to 154\% for dexamethasone and from 78 to 105\% for
   clenbuterol. The limit of detection was 1.43 ng g(-1) and 0.43 ng g(-1)
   respectively. The limit of quantification for dexamethasone was 2.09 ng
   g(-1) and for clenbuterol was 0.72 ng g(-1). The combination of the new

Abstract = {{Streptococcosis caused by Lactococcus garvieae is currently the
   bacterial disease causing the highest mortality in Italian rainbow trout
   farming. Since 1991, when it first appeared, the disease continued to
   spread, mainly in the northern regions. In the worst cases, mortality
   reached nearly 50\%; the outbreaks occur during the summer, when the
   water temperatures are higher than 15 degrees C. Chances to effectively
   control the disease are very limited because of the lack of useful and
   legally approved drugs. Fish suffering the disease are usually close to
   market size and farmers are unable to treat the disease unless they risk
   considerably delaying marketing in order to comply with withdrawal
   periods. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to develop
   vaccination programmes. In the present study, two normally reared groups
   of rainbow trout were vaccinated by intraperitoneal injection with a
   formalin-killed vaccine. The first trial was conducted between May and
   October with fish weighing at mean 1.360 kg. The mortality in the

Abstract = {{The present work deals with the discovery of a distinctive morphology in
   the male reproductive apparatus of the red swamp crayfish, Procambarus
   clarkii (Girard, 1852), from two Italian lakes (where it was introduced
   a few years ago from different foreign countries). Anatomy and histology
   of the male reproductive apparatus were investigated in a large sample
   of the crayfish populations. Males were characterized by the presence of
   a tri-lobate testis and, as a rule, of a single sperm duct ton the right
   body side). Furthermore, a comparison of the same anatomical structures
   was made taking into consideration two other crayfish secies: Astacus
   leptodactylus and Orconectes limosus. Observations on these crustaceans
   showed a bi-lobate testis and no morphological differences between the
   normally developed left and right vasa deferentia. The presence of a
   single sperm duct and of three testicular lobes in P. clarkii might be
   related to its burrowing-reproductive habit. One single vas deferens may
   be an adaptation to burrow environments where copulation is not affected
   by water flow, while three testicular lobes may act as a mechanism to
   make the spermatogenetic process active all year round, thus enhancing
   the probabilities of success in reproduction.}},

   The high performance of this medium has been demonstrated by a +14.7\%

Abstract = {{In recent years in vitro models have been developed to avoid the use of
   animals in cutaneous toxicological studies. Submerged human keratinocyte
   cultures in vitro could be so far employed as an alternative to animal
   testing and a good correlation between skin irritation and cytotoxicity
   has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, these submerged cultures are
   lacking in the stratum corneum which acts as a barrier to chemical
   toxicity, so that this type of culture is far from the in vivo
   situation. A better alternative method seems to be the use of in vitro
   reconstructed skin at the air-liquid interface that closely resembles
   the in vivo Situation. In this work, in a first step we have
   characterized human epidermis reconstructed in vitro on de-epidermized
   derma (DED) after a two-week air exposure. Human skin reconstituted in
   vitro on DED was histologically similar to the in vivo skin. A
   stratified epidermis including the stratum corneum was obtained. The
   presence of basal lamina as well as of various important markers for
   epidermal differentiation (involucrin, K10 keratin, and filaggrin) were
   revealed. In a second step we have tested the cytotoxic and
   morphological effects of four surfactants on our model. A good rank
   correlation has been shown to exist between the irritation potency of
   surfactants on our model and reported ocular irritancy in vivo. From our
   results, in vitro reconstituted human skin could represent an attractive
   model for irritancy testing and could be an in vitro replacement for
   animal testing. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Sphaerospora sp. (Myxosporea) infection (presumably S. truttae) was
   identified on a trout farm in northeastern Italy. Parasites were
   detected in kidneys from infected brown trout, Salmo trutta L., over a
   2-year period. Extrasporogonic, sporogonic stages and mature spores were
   simultaneously detected in the same fish. Traditional diagnostic methods
   for Sphaerospora spp. rely on the detection of the myxosporean
   developmental stages in Giemsa-stained kidney smears or
   haematoxylin-eosin stained tissue sections. A histochemical method was
   employed where 10 biotinylated lectins (Con-A, DBA, SBA, GS-I, PHA-P,
   LEA, PWM, RCA(1), WGA and UEA-I) and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase
   complex (ABC) were used on Sphaerospora-infected brown trout renal
   tissues and kidney imprints. Five monoclonal antibodies against PKX (Mab
   12, MabA3, MabC5, MabD4 and MabB4) were also tested. A lectin
   glycoconjugate binding pattern for Sphaerospora spp. is presented. This
   staining method shows that SBA lectin (Glycine max agglutinin) is a
   useful tool for the detection of the Sphaerospora spp. Only MabB4 bound
   some of the most mature sporogonic stages. In contrast Mabs12, A3, C5
   and D4, and GS-I lectin (Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin) did not
   stain any of the Sphaerospora spp. stages, but did bind very
   specifically to the sporogonic and extrasporogonic stages of PKX, the
   causative agent of proliferative kidney disease (PKD).}},

   two new benzopsoralen derivatives, was tested on HL60 and HeLa cell
   lints in the dark and by UVA irradiation; 8-methoxypsoralen was used as
   a reference compound. The action of the compounds was evaluated by means
   of the neutral red uptake assay, by means of ultrastructure, morphometry
   and interaction with human erythrocytes membrane. In both HL60 and HeLa
   cell lines benzopsoralen derivatives showed more antiproliferative
   activity after UVA irradiation, however less than 8-methoxypsoralen.
   Compound 1 was more effective than compound 2 both in the dark and after
   UVA irradiation. The ultrastructure showed a morphological rank damage
   caused by these compounds: compound 2 induced slight modifications in
   the cytoplasm organization, compound 1 induced some vacuolizations and
   8-methoxypsoralen generated plenty of vacuoles and an empty space around
   the nucleus. Morphometrical data in HL60 cells turned out to be in
   accordance with the different action mechanisms existing between
   8-methoxypsoralen and the two benzopsoralen derivatives; in HeLa cells
   we noted an increase in the nuclear area induced by all the three
   compounds. Only compound 1 caused the formation of echinocytes both in
   the dark and after UVA irradiation, suggesting the involvement of a
   mechanism not strictly related to DNA interaction and singlet oxygen
   production.}},

   characterize this method: the simultaneous determination of a wide
   spectrum of drugs; good performance of the purification system; and high
   recoveries, The method was tested for a determination limit of 1 ppm in
   each compound, Average recoveries of spiked samples were: 99\% for
   sulfonamides; 98\% for nitrofurans; and 100\% for carbadox

Abstract = {{We have developed a fast and convenient detection method for the

   bacterium Yersinia ruckeri, using the random amplification of
   polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique to design specific primers for a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnosis. In the RAPD genomic
   fingerprint of Y. ruckeri, a specific band was observed which gave no
   cross-hybridization with the genomes of other bacteria in Southern blot
   analysis. This band was cloned, sequenced, and found to bear no homology
   with known DNA sequences. Two primers were then synthesized to amplify
   by PCR the fragment lying between the terminal RAPD primer sequences of
   the band. The PCR assay detected specifically 3 serotypes of Y. ruckeri
   (serotypes O1, O2, and unknown) in samples with whole bacteria. It also
   detected the bacterium in kidney tissue from infected trout after brief
   digestion with proteinase K. Sample preparation was kept simple to
   minimize the risk of false positives due to inter-sample contamination.
   Because of its speed, inherent sensitivity, and apparent specificity we
   concluded that this diagnostic system was preferable to conventional
   bacteriological diagnostic tests.}},

   17 different patterns (3 of them included 158 strains). The analysis of
   the relationship between pattern and antibiotic resistance showed that
   Tetracycline MIC values could be related to plasmid pattern 3, while
   Rifaximin MIC values to biotype pattern 9. Moreover, a significant
   association betweeen strains with plasmid pattern 3 and lower level in
   milk PMNs (and higher level of Macrophages) of infected quarters was
   demonstrated. Most of the strains within these 2 patterns were isolated
   from only two herds. Our results suggest that biological and

Abstract = {{A virus, strain 583, was isolated from carpione Salmo trutta carpio fry
   exhibiting high mortality. The virus was not neutralized by rabbit
   antisera against the fish rhabdbviruses viral haemorrhagic septicaemia
   virus (VHSV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, eel rhabdovirus
   European X, spring viraemia of carp virus or pike fry rhabdovirus, or
   against the birnavirus infectious pancreatic necrosis virus. The virus
   replicated in several fish cell lines incubated at 20 to 25 degrees C
   and grew optimally in the bluegill fry (BF-2) and fathead minnow (FHM)
   cell lines. Electron microscopy of infected BF-2 cell cultures revealed
   the presence of typical rhabdovirus particles, and immunofluorescent
   staining was observed using various polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies
   (MAbs) against Egtved virus, the causative agent of viral haemorrhagic
   septicaemia. The staining by a MAb against the nucleoprotein (N) of VHSV
   was particularly strong, a MAb against the glycoprotein (G) gave a
   moderate reaction, whereas a second MAb against the G protein and MAbs
   against the matrix proteins, M(1) and M(2), of VHSV did not react.
   Fluorescence titres using 3 rabbit antisera against whole Egtved virus
   varied between negative and moderately positive. Western blotting using
   polyclonal and monoclonal sera confirmed that both the N and G proteins
   of the carpione virus shared some epitopes with those of VHSV, but the
   M(1) and M(2) proteins did not. SDS-PAGE showed the structural proteins
   of the carpione virus produced a pattern typical of members of the
   Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae and the molecular weights were
   very similar to those of VHSV, except for the M(2) protein which was
   somewhat smaller. Infection trials showed the carpione virus induced
   high mortalities in carpione fry but not in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
   mykiss fry. The carpione virus was clearly distinguishable from Egtved
   virus despite limited serological cross reaction. Since it was also
   easily distinguishable by immunofluorescence from the other fish
   rhabdoviruses included in the present study as well as in studies
   published elsewhere, it is concluded that the virus is a previously
   undescribed one. It is proposed that the virus be given the preliminary
   designation `carpione rhabdovirus'.}},

Abstract = {{The performances of three enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
   and one radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 17 alpha-19-nortestosterone (17
   alpha-19-NT) analysis of bovine urine have been evaluated. Sample
   preparation was performed by enzymic deconjugation and solid-phase
   extraction. The main object of the study was the evaluation of the
   matrix effect, which is generally great in 19-NT immunoassays.
   Fifty-seven bovine urine samples have been analysed by immunoassay and
   by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The defection limit of
   GC-MS analysis was 1 mu g l(-1). The mean sample blank values in urine
   analysis were close to 1.5 mu g l(-1) for one ELISA, and 0.4-0.8 mu g
   l(-1) for the other assays (n = 55, samples coming from several breeds
   in different geographic areas). The detection limits, calculated in
   compliance to the EEC criteria, were 2.67, 1.97, 2.05 and 5.01 mu g
   l(-1) for RIA, ELISAs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The percentage of fate
   positive results adopting this criteria were: 1.8, 3.6, 1.8 and 3.6\%.
   The probability of the occurrence of false negative results was
   evaluated by adding 2 mu g l(-1) of 19-NT to a negative sample, was high
   in each assay, Two;samples from experimentally treated animals gave
   positive results both in GC-MS and in immunoassays. The results obtained
   confirm that be employing immunoassay and solid-phase extraction as
   sample clean-up, it is not possible to apply the action level (2 ppb)
   suggested by the European Union (EU).}},

   hives treated using the second schedule, efficacy of 98.8\% was
   obtained. As controls, 10 hives treated with Apistan were used. No
   adverse effects on bees were observed in the hives treated with formic

   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for the screening of
   beta-agonists are presented. The kit was adopted as a screening method
   because it allows very rapid multi-analyte detection without extraction.
   Beta-Agonists such as clenbuterol, mabuterol, salbutamol and terbutaline
   can be detected in bovine urine with a decision limit of 0.6, 0.9, 1.6
   and 2.5 ng ml-1, respectively, Confirmation of positive ELISA results
   concerning the presence of clenbuterol and salbutamol was made by liquid
   chromatography and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with
   immunoaffinity clean-up. By employing the described strategy, in a
   5-month period, 59 out of 815 samples were found to be positive.
   Positive groups of samples were from both therapeutic and anabolic use
   of beta-agonist drugs. Adopting 1 ng ml-1 clenbuterol as a cut-off
   value, the percentage of unconfirmed positive ELISA herds was 3.6\%. The
   reliability of the overall control strategy and of the kit in terms of
   the percentage of false-positive results is evaluated.}},
