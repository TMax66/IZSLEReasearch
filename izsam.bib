abstract={Prompt identification of the causative pathogen of an infectious disease is essential for the choice of treatment or preventive measures. In this perspective, nucleic acids purified from the brain tissue of a dog succumbed after severe neurological signs were processed with the MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford UK) sequencing technology. Canine distemper virus (CDV) sequence reads were detected. Subsequently, a specific molecular test and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm the presence of CDV RNA and antigen, respectively, in tissues. This study supports the use of the NGS in veterinary clinical practice with potential advantages in terms of rapidity and broad-range of molecular diagnosis. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a segmented double-stranded RNA virus, existing in multiple serotypes, belonging to the genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae. BTV causes Bluetongue (BT), a major OIE-listed disease of ruminants. Identification of BTV serotype is accomplished using multiple typing assays and tends to be executed based on the known epidemiological situation within a given country. Samples containing multiple serotypes, particularly those containing novel introductions, may therefore be missed. The aim of this work was to optimize the nCounter® Analysis System Microarray platform (NanoString technologies), that would simultaneously identify all BTV serotypes and co-infections in analyzed samples. Probes were designed according to all Seg-2 sequences, coding for VP2 proteins which determine serotype specificity, available on line. A specific BTV CodeSet of probes was optimized. Experiments were performed with 30 BTV isolates and with 46 field samples previously shown to be infected with BTV by classical molecular assays. All BTV isolates were correctly identified and the expected BTV serotype was recognized in 35 field samples with CT values between 22.0–33.0. In turn, it was unable to identify 11 samples with CT values between 29.0–38.0. Although specificity of the assay needs to be further investigated against a larger panel of BTVs collected worldwide, RNA loads, which are normally detected in blood samples during the acute phase of infection, are within the range of CT values detectable by the BTV CodeSet. We propose the NanoString RNA microarray as a first-line molecular diagnostic tool for identification and typing of BTV. Once identification of the index cases is performed, diagnosis of the following samples may be performed by specific, more sensitive and cheaper PCR-based tools. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Ex vivo organ cultures (EVOCs) are extensively used to study the cellular tropism and infectivity of different pathogens. In this study, we used ovine and porcine respiratory EVOCs to investigate the replication kinetics and cellular tropism of selected emerging reoviruses namely Pteropine orthoreovirus, an emerging bat-borne zoonotic respiratory virus, and atypical Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes which, unlike classical serotypes, do not cause Bluetongue, a major OIE-listed disease of ruminants. BTV failed to replicate in ovine EVOCs. Instead, PRV showed slight replication in porcine lower respiratory EVOCs and a more sustained replication in all ovine respiratory tissues. By confocal laser scanning microscopy, PRV was demonstrated to infect bronchiolar and type I pneumocytes of ovine tissues. Overall, respiratory EVOCs from different animal species, eventually obtained at slaughterhouse, are a useful tool for testing and preliminarily characterize novel and emerging viruses addressing the essential in vivo animal work. Further experiments are, indeed, warranted in order to characterize the pathogenesis and transmission of these emerging reoviruses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Swine brucellosis due to Brucella suis biovar 2 (bv2) is enzootic in wild boar and hare in continental Europe and may cause major economic losses to the pig industry, mainly in free-ranged pig farms. The high nucleotide identity found among the B. suis biovar 2 isolates has long hindered the full understanding of the epidemiology and the phylogeography of the disease. Here, we used multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) and whole-genome analysis to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to gain insights from the largest B. suis bv2 dataset analyzed so far composed of domestic pigs and wildlife isolates collected throughout Europe since the 1970s. We found four major clades with a specific phylogeographic pattern. The Iberian clade contains isolates exclusively from the Iberian Peninsula. The Central European clade includes most isolates from France, Northern Italy, Switzerland and an important proportion of those of Northern Spain. The Eastern European clade clustered isolates from Croatia and Hungary mainly but also from areas of France, Germany, Italy and Poland. Finally, a separated Sardinian clade grouped three isolates from this island. At fine scale, MLVA demonstrated an endemic status of the infection in Europe and it allowed tracking a large outbreak formed by different farms from Spain linked to the same infection source. The whole genome SNP analysis showed that the strains form genetically distinct clades, shared between wild boar and pigs, in agreement with the MLVA clades. Interestingly, all hare isolates clustered together within two groups composed exclusively of wildlife isolates. Our results support the hypothesis that maintenance and spread of B. suis bv2 in Europe is a dynamic process linked to the natural expansion of wild boar as the main wild reservoir of the infection, while spread over long distances is found largely dependent on anthropogenic activities. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Coxiella burnetii causes diseases in humans (Q fever) and animals, domestic ruminants playing a major role in the epidemiology of the infection. Information on C. burnetii infection in Lebanon is scanty. In order to assess the prevalence of C. burnetii infection in ruminants, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in 2014. A total of 1633 sera from ruminants (865 cattle, 384 sheep and 384 goats) from 429 farms (173 cattle, 128 sheep and 128 goats), in seven provinces of Lebanon were randomly selected and assayed for the presence of antibodies. 39.86% of farms (95% CI: 35.23–44.56) resulted positive. The seroprevalence was 30.63% in Cattle-farms, 46.88% in sheep-farms and 45.31% in goat-farms. Milk samples collected from 282 seropositive animals (86 cows, 93 sheep and 103 goats) from 171 positive farms were tested by a high sensitive Real-Time PCR targeted to the IS1111 transposon of C. burnetii. The overall prevalence in farms was estimated to be 14.04%. Cattle-, sheep- and goat farm prevalence rates were 15.09%, 10% and 17.24%, respectively. The findings of the study show that C. burnetii prevalence in Lebanese domestic ruminants is related to animal species and farming practices. Indeed, the mixed herds with sheep (p < 0.01), the presence of common lambing/kidding areas (p < 0.001) in farms where the use of disinfectants was not a routine practice (p < 0.05) were identified as important risk factors. The results of the study provide baseline information for setting up herd management and public health measures for the prevention and control of Q fever in Lebanon. © 2019},

abstract={American foulbrood (AFB) of Apis mellifera, caused by the bacterial spore former Paenibacillus larvae, is a notifiable disease in Italy and its spread is prevented by burning hives with clinical symptoms. Official epidemiological data indicate a very low number of annual outbreaks in the country, therefore this investigation was carried out to evaluate whether notification to the veterinary authority is omitted, so that AFB transmission from infected apiaries is not prevented. Presence and number of P. larvae spores were analyzed in 122 honey samples, each from a different apiary, collected in the Abruzzo region in years 2014 and 2015. P. larvae spores were found in 40% of the samples and the spore numbers allowed to infer a prevalence of AFB of at least 22.7% among beekeepers, indicating the necessity to improve the surveillance system. Spore numbers were significantly different for honeys produced in different environmental contexts and with varying management practices, suggesting to elucidate the causal relationship between those factors and the presence of P. larvae spores. © 2019, © 2019 International Bee Research Association.},

abstract={Equine trypanosomosis is a complex of infectious diseases called dourine, nagana and surra. It is caused by several species of the genus Trypanosoma that are transmitted cyclically by tsetse flies, mechanically by other haematophagous flies, or sexually. Trypanosoma congolense (subgenus Nannomonas) and T. vivax (subgenus Dutonella) are genetically and morphologically distinct from T. brucei, T. equiperdum and T. evansi (subgenus Trypanozoon). It remains controversial whether the three latter taxa should be considered distinct species. Recent outbreaks of surra and dourine in Europe illustrate the risk and consequences of importation of equine trypanosomosis with infected animals into non-endemic countries. Knowledge on the epidemiological situation is fragmentary since many endemic countries do not report the diseases to the World Organisation for Animal Health, OIE. Other major obstacles to the control of equine trypanosomosis are the lack of vaccines, the inability of drugs to cure the neurological stage of the disease, the inconsistent case definition and the limitations of current diagnostics. Especially in view of the ever-increasing movement of horses around the globe, there is not only the obvious need for reliable curative and prophylactic drugs but also for accurate diagnostic tests and algorithms. Unfortunately, clinical signs are not pathognomonic, parasitological tests are not sufficiently sensitive, serological tests miss sensitivity or specificity, and molecular tests cannot distinguish the taxa within the Trypanozoon subgenus. To address the limitations of the current diagnostics for equine trypanosomosis, we recommend studies into improved molecular and serological tests with the highest possible sensitivity and specificity. We realise that this is an ambitious goal, but it is dictated by needs at the point of care. However, depending on available treatment options, it may not always be necessary to identify which trypanosome taxon is responsible for a given infection. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={People re-identification task has seen enormous improvements in the latest years, mainly due to the development of better image features extraction from deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the availability of large datasets. However, little research has been conducted on animal identification and re-identification, even if this knowledge may be useful in a rich variety of different scenarios. Here, we tackle cattle re-identification exploiting deep CNN and show how this task is poorly related with the human one, presenting unique challenges that makes it far from being solved. We present various baselines, both based on deep architectures or on standard machine learning algorithms, and compared them with our solution. Finally, a rich ablation study has been conducted to further investigate the unique peculiarities of this task. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Introduction. Job performance has several predictors that are both individual and organizational. According to the existing literature, the learning climate meant as organizational dimension can boost a virtuous circle involving identity factors, proactivity and care for customers as well. Methods. It has been applied a quantitative methodology, 57 workers from the health department have filled in an ad hoc questionnaire. Learning climate, general health and job performance have been evaluated. Results. The tested mediation model is statistically significant, showing that the learning climate has both a direct effect on job performance and an indirect effect mediated by the general health. Conclusions. The small sample is the most relevant limit of the study, on the positive side the study takes into account all the dimensions of the learning climate and of the general health, while in the past the focus was just on single aspects of those variables. © 2019 Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

abstract={Mycoplasma species are responsible for several economically significant livestock diseases for which there is a need for new and improved vaccines. Most of the existing mycoplasma vaccines are attenuated strains that have been empirically obtained by serial passages or by chemical mutagenesis. The recent development of synthetic biology approaches has opened the way for the engineering of live mycoplasma vaccines. Using these tools, the essential GTPase-encoding gene obg was modified directly on the Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri genome cloned in yeast, reproducing mutations suspected to induce a temperature-sensitive (TS+) phenotype. After transplantation of modified genomes into a recipient cell, the phenotype of the resulting M. mycoides subsp. capri mutants was characterized. Single-point obg mutations did not result in a strong TS+ phenotype in M. mycoides subsp. capri, but a clone presenting three obg mutations was shown to grow with difficulty at temperatures of ≥40°C. This particular mutant was then tested in a caprine septicemia model of M. mycoides subsp. capri infection. Five out of eight goats infected with the parental strain had to be euthanized, in contrast to one out of eight goats infected with the obg mutant, demonstrating an attenuation of virulence in the mutant. Moreover, the strain isolated from the euthanized animal in the group infected with the obg mutant was shown to carry a reversion in the obg gene associated with the loss of the TS+ phenotype. This study demonstrates the feasibility of building attenuated strains of mycoplasma that could contribute to the design of novel vaccines with improved safety. © 2019 Lartigue et al.},

abstract={Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a viral disease that affects cattle and that is endemic to many European countries. It has a markedly negative impact on the economy, through reduced milk production, abortions, and a shorter lifespan of the infected animals. Cows becoming infected during gestation may give birth to Persistently Infected (PI) calves, which remain highly infective throughout their life, due to the lack of immune response to the virus. As a result, they are the key driver of the persistence of the disease both at herd scale, and at the national level. In the latter case, the trade-driven movements of PIs, or gestating cows carrying PIs, are responsible for the spatial dispersion of BVD. Past modeling approaches to BVD transmission have either focused on within-herd or between-herd transmission. A comprehensive portrayal, however, targeting both the generation of PIs within a herd, and their displacement throughout the country due to trade transactions, is still missing. We overcome this by designing a multiscale metapopulation model of the spatial transmission of BVD, accounting for both within-herd infection dynamics, and its spatial dispersion. We focus on Italy, a country where BVD is endemic and seroprevalence is very high. By integrating simple within-herd dynamics of PI generation, and the highly-resolved cattle movement dataset available, our model requires minimal arbitrary assumptions on its parameterization. We use our model to study the role of the different productive contexts of the Italian market, and test possible intervention strategies aimed at prevalence reduction. We find that dairy farms are the main drivers of BVD persistence in Italy, and any control strategy targeting these farms would lead to significantly higher prevalence reduction, with respect to targeting other production compartments. Our multiscale metapopulation model is a simple yet effective tool for studying BVD dispersion and persistence at country level, and is a good instrument for testing targeted strategies aimed at the containment or elimination of this disease. Furthermore, it can readily be applied to any national market for which cattle movement data is available. © 2019},

abstract={Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a complex zoonosis with domestic and sylvatic life-cycles, involving different intermediate and definitive host species. Many previous studies have highlighted the lack of a surveillance system for CE, its persistence in Italy, and endemicity in several Italian regions. Because of the absence of a uniform surveillance program for both humans and animals, disease occurrence is widely underestimated. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. Survey data on the prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus complex infections in Italian sheep farms from 2010 to 2015 were obtained in collaboration with Regional Veterinary Epidemiology Observatories (OEVRs). Bayesian analysis was performed to estimate the true CE farm prevalence. The prior true CE prevalence was estimated using data from Sardinia. Second, Bayesian modelling of the observed prevalence in different regions and the true prevalence estimation from the first step were used to ultimately estimate the prevalence of ovine CE in Italy. We obtained survey data from 10 OEVRs, covering 14 Italian regions. We observed that the risk of CE infection decreased over the years, and it was strictly correlated with the density of susceptible species. Using Sardinia as prior distribution, where the disease farm prevalence was approximately 19% (95% CI, 18.82–20.02), we estimated that the highest endemic CE farm prevalence was in Basilicata with a value of 12% (95% BCI: 7.49–18.9%) and in Piemonte 7.64%(95% BCI: 4.12–13.04%). Our results provide spatially relevant data crucial for guiding CE control in Italy. Precise information on disease occurrence location would aid in the identification of priority areas for disease control implementation by the authorities. The current underestimation of CE occurrence should urge the Italian and European governments to become aware of the public health importance of CE and implement targeted interventions for high-risk areas. © 2019 Loi et al.

abstract={To evaluate the immunological response following vaccination, 40 WNV serologically negative horses were selected and divided in two groups of 20 animals. One group was vaccinated (booster after 28 days) with a whole inactivated viral strain and the second group with a live recombinant canarypox virus expressing the genes coding for the WNV preM/E viral proteins. IgM, IgG and neutralizing antibodies were monitored by class specific ELISAs and serum neutralization assay for 360 days. In both groups, IgM antibodies were first detected 7 days post vaccination (dpv). However, in the group vaccinated with inactivated vaccine, IgM antibodies were detected until day 42 pv, whereas in the group vaccinated with the recombinant vaccine, they were detected up to day 52 pv. A similar (P > 0.05) proportion of horses showed IgM antibodies after vaccination with either recombinant [30%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 14.59%-52.18%] or inactivated (32%; 95% CI: 15.39-54.28%) vaccine. Both vaccines induced in vaccinated horses a detectable IgG antibody response starting from day 7 pv and lasting till the end of the trial. Analogously, both products elicited WNV specific neutralizing antibodies. The response induced by the live canarypox virus-vectored vaccine was higher (mean titres 1:298 vs 1:18.9) and lasted longer than did that induced by the killed-virus vaccines. In fact, one year after the vaccination, neutralizing antibodies were still detectable in the horses which received the canarypox virus-based vaccine but not in the group vaccinated with the killed product. The use of vaccines is a valuable tool to prevent WNV disease in horses and the availability of different products facilitates the control of the disease in endemic areas.},

abstract={From November 2016 to April 2017, a cross-sectional study to determine the sero-prevalence of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and to investigate its epidemiology was conducted in selected districts of Borana zone in Ethiopia. In addition, the study aimed at identifying Mccp antigens using species specific primer of PCR. A multistage random sampling was implemented to select districts, pastoral associations (villages), and households. A total of 890 serum samples of small ruminants that had not been vaccinated (goats n = 789 and sheep n = 101) were collected and screened for the presence of antibodies against Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lung tissues and pleural fluid samples were collected from 3 sero-positive and clinically suspected goats for isolation of Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae. Serology showed that overall 31.2% (246/789) of goats and 12.9% (13/101) of sheep were positive with statistically significant differences between districts (p = 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that goats from Moyale and Yabello districts had higher odds of being positive than goats from Elwoya district with odd ratios of 2.05 and 1.61, respectively. Age of goats was also significantly associated with sero-positivity (OR = 1.47; CI 95% 1.2–1.8). Mycoplasma capricolum subspecies capripneumoniae was identified in 6 (75%) of the tissue samples using species-specific primer of PCR. Besides improving the understanding of the epidemiology of CCPP in the selected districts and demonstrating its wide distribution, the study highly also provides evidence of the possible role of sheep in the maintenance of the disease. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Brucellosis is a major public health problem still prevalent as a neglected endemic zoonosis requiring proactive attention in many communities worldwide. The present study involved analysis of Brucella field strains submitted for typing to the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis from 2007 to 2015. Strains were identified at the species and biovar levels by classic and molecular techniques according to the World Organisation for Animal Health Manual. In total, 5,784 strains were typed: 3,089 Brucella abortus (53.4%), 2,497 B. melitensis (43.2%), 10 B. ovis (0.2%), 181 B. suis (3.1%), and 7 B. ceti (0.1%). The 2,981 strains from cattle were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3, and 6 (90.1%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (9.9%). The 318 strains from water buffalo were typed as B. abortus biovars 1, 3 (95.9%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (4.1%). The 2,279 strains from sheep and goats were typed as B. abortus biovars 1 and 3 (4.3%); B. melitensis biovars 1, 3, (95.3%); and B. ovis (0.4%). The 173 strains from wild boar were typed as B. suis biovar 2 (98.3%) and B. melitensis biovar 3 (1.7%). The 11 strains from pigs were typed as B. suis biovar 2. The 13 strains from humans were typed as B. melitensis biovar 3. The two strains from horses were typed as B. abortus biovar 1, while the seven strains from dolphins were typed as B. ceti. This additional knowledge on the epidemiology of brucellosis in Italy may be useful to formulate policies and strategies for the control and eradication of the disease in animal populations. The animal species affected, biovars typed, geographical origins, and spatial distributions of isolates are herein analyzed and discussed. © 2019 De Massis et al.

abstract={Here we report studies of the antigenic relationship of West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV), two zoonotic flaviviruses from Italy, together with a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain and compared them with their genetic relationship using the immunodominant viral E protein. Thirty-nine isolates and reference strains were inactivated and used to immunize rabbits to produce hyper immune sera. Serum samples were tested by neutralization against all isolates and results visualized by generating antigenic map. Strains of WNV, USUV, and JEV grouped in separate clusters on the antigenic map. JEV was closer antigenically to USUV (mean of 3.5 Antigenic Unit, AU, equivalent to a 2-fold change in antibody titer) than to WNV strains (mean of 6 AU). A linear regression model predicted, on average, one unit of antigenic change, equivalent to a 2-fold change in antibody titer, for every 22 amino acid substitutions in the E protein ectodomain. Overall, antigenic map was demonstrated to be robust and consistent with phylogeny of the E protein. Indeed, the map provided a reliable means of visualizing and quantifying the relationship between these flaviviruses. Further antigenic analyses employing representative strains of extant serocomplexes are currently underway. This will provide a more in deep knowledge of antigenic relationships between flaviviruses. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a major natural cause of morbidity and mortality in cetaceans worldwide and results in epidemic and endemic fatalities. The pathogenesis of CeMV has not been fully elucidated, and questions remain regarding tissue tropism and the mechanisms of immunosuppression. We compared the histopathologic and viral immunohistochemical features in molecularly confirmed CeMV-infected Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from the Southwestern Atlantic (Brazil) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Northeast-Central Atlantic (Canary Islands, Spain) and the Western Mediterranean Sea (Italy). Major emphasis was placed on the central nervous system (CNS), including neuroanatomical distribution of lesions, and the lymphoid system and lung were also examined. Eleven Guiana dolphins, 13 striped dolphins, and 3 bottlenose dolphins were selected by defined criteria. CeMV infections showed a remarkable neurotropism in striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins, while this was a rare feature in CeMV-infected Guiana dolphins. Neuroanatomical distribution of lesions in dolphins stranded in the Canary Islands revealed a consistent involvement of the cerebrum, thalamus, and cerebellum, followed by caudal brainstem and spinal cord. In most cases, Guiana dolphins had more severe lung lesions. The lymphoid system was involved in all three species, with consistent lymphoid depletion. Multinucleate giant cells/ syncytia and characteristic viral inclusion bodies were variably observed in these organs. Overall, there was widespread lymphohistiocytic, epithelial, and neuronal/neuroglial viral antigen immunolabeling with some individual, host species, and CeMV strain differences. Preexisting and opportunistic infections were common, particularly endoparasitism, followed by bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. These results contribute to understanding CeMV infections in susceptible cetacean hosts in relation to factors such as CeMV strains and geographic locations, thereby establishing the basis for future neuro- and immunopathological comparative investigations. © 2019 Díaz-Delgado et al.

abstract={In this study, an immunology-based assay that employed specific monoclonal antibodies binding with somatic or flagella antigens of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica was performed. As this pathogen is one of the most important bacterial species responsible for foodborne outbreaks, its detection in food by rapid and easy methods is properly suitable. After a first screening by indirect ELISA, three monoclonal antibodies (1B6D9, 1B6C11, 1D12F11) versusS. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 (whole antigen) and another one (4E6F11) versusS. enterica flagellin were further characterized by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analysis. Then, a total of 84 food samples (dairy products, meat, pasta and flour, eggs, and animal feed) were analyzed by both the official method ISO 6579:2002 and S. enterica capture ELISA. For the standardization of the last method, the specific monoclonal antibody 4E6F11 was selected. The developed Salmonella capture ELISA showed a significant agreement with the official method (ISO 6579:2002). Relative sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 81.0%, and 90.5%, respectively. Therefore, this assay could represent a valid alternative to conventional methods able to detect this pathogen in food. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), caused by Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae is a severe disease widespread in Africa and Asia. Limited knowledge is available on the pathogenesis of this organism, mainly due to the lack of a robust in vivo challenge model and the means to do site-directed mutagenesis. This work describes the establishment of a novel caprine challenge model for CCPP that resulted in 100% morbidity using a combination of repeated intranasal spray infection followed by a single transtracheal infection employing the recent Kenyan outbreak strain ILRI181. Diseased animals displayed CCPP-related pathology and the bacteria could subsequently be isolated from pleural exudates and lung tissues in concentrations of up to 10 9 bacteria per mL as well as in the trachea using immunohistochemistry. Reannotation of the genome sequence of ILRI181 and F38 T revealed the existence of genes encoding the complete glycerol uptake and metabolic pathways involved in hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production in the phylogenetically related pathogen M. mycoides subsp. mycoides. Furthermore, the expression of L-α-glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) in vivo was confirmed. In addition, the function of the glycerol metabolism was verified by measurement of production of H 2 O 2 in medium containing physiological serum concentrations of glycerol. Peroxide production could be inhibited with serum from convalescent animals. These results will pave the way for a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions during CCPP and subsequent vaccine development. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={European Union (EU) and United States (US) regulations implement different food safety standards, particularly relating to the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in certain ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products. Compared to EU, the US adopt different procedures and methods, and establish zero tolerance limits to ensure consumers protection from Listeria monocytogenes in RTE products. A complete equivalence evaluation of the EU and US food inspection and certification systems has not been carried out yet. This study was funded by the Italian Central Competent Authority in the field of food safety (Ministry of Health) and included a total of 164 Italian establishments, 81 authorized for export of pork meat products to US (“US establishments”) and 83 only authorized for EU internal trade (“EU establishments”). Establishments were stratified according to production volume, type of RTE products manufactured, presentation and processing, in order to include two homogeneous groups (US and EU). Sampling was carried out by NAS (Carabinieri Corps for the prevention of the adulteration of beverages and foodstuffs) without any given notice. Sampling, detection and identification of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. took place according to US Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) directives and procedures. All 1124 samples tested negative for Salmonella spp., while 5 samples tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Among the latter, 4 samples were collected in 3 US establishments (US products prevalence 4/556 = 0.72%, 95% CL: 0.29–1.83%; US establishments prevalence 3/81 = 3.70%, 95% CL: 1.34–10.32%) and 1 was collected in a EU establishment (EU products prevalence 1/568 = 0.18%, 95% CL: 0.04–0.98%; EU establishment prevalence 1/83 = 1.20%, 95% CL: 0.29–0.46%). Bilateral Fisher's exact test showed no differences between EU and US products and establishments prevalence (P = 0.213 and P = 0.364, respectively), corroborating the existence of equivalent Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. contamination in the products under these two control systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The epidemiological patterns of Bluetongue (BT) in North Africa and Mediterranean Basin (MB) dramatically changed by emergence of subsequent episodes of novel bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes with highly pathogenic indexes and socio-economic impacts. The objective of the study was to investigate the sero-prevalence and serotype distribution of BTV in Libya. During 2015-2016, a total of 826 serum samples were collected from domestic ruminants in Libya. All sera were assayed by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (c-ELISA). C-Elisa-positive samples (43.3%; 173/400) were further analyzed by virus neutralization assay to identify BTV serotypes and determine the antibody titre of positive samples. An overall BTV sero-prevalence was 48.4% (95% CI: 45.0%-51.8%). Neutralizing antibodies were detected against the following BTV serotypes namely: BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-3, BTV-4, BTV-9 and BTV-26. While BTV-1, BTV-2, BTV-4 and BTV-9 circulation was unsurprising as they have been responsible of the last year outbreaks in Northern African Countries, the detection of BTV-3 and BTV-26 was definitely new and concerning for the animal health of the countries facing the Mediterranean Basin. It is crucial that European and Northern African authorities collaborate in organizing common surveillance programmes to early detect novel strains or emerging serotypes in order to set up proper preventive measures, and, in case, develop specific vaccines and plan coordinated vaccination campaigns. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Food packaging is not only a simple protective barrier, but a real “active” component, which is expected to preserve food quality, safety and shelf-life. Therefore, the materials used for packaging production should show peculiar features and properties. Specifically, antimicrobial packaging has recently gained great attention with respect to both social and economic impacts. In this paper, the results obtained by using a polymer material functionalized by a small synthetic peptide as “active” packaging are reported. The surface of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), one of the most commonly used plastic materials in food packaging, was plasma-activated and covalently bio-conjugated to a bactenecin-derivative peptide named 1018K6, previously characterized in terms of antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities. The immobilization of the peptide occurred at a high yield and no release was observed under different environmental conditions. Moreover, preliminary data clearly demonstrated that the “active” packaging was able to significantly reduce the total bacterial count together with yeast and mold spoilage in food-dairy products. Finally, the functionalized-PET polymer showed stronger efficiency in inhibiting biofilm growth, using a Listeria monocytogenes strain isolated from food products. The use of these “active” materials would greatly decrease the risk of pathogen development and increase the shelf-life in the food industry, showing a real potential against a panel of microorganisms upon exposure to fresh and stored products, high chemical stability and re-use possibility. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={Bluetongue (BT) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) are globally re-emerging diseases of domestic and wild ruminants, respectively caused by BT virus (BTV) and EHD virus. Both viruses are transmitted by hematophagous midges; however, newly recognized BTV serotypes may be transmitted horizontally without requirement for any biological vector. The global range of these viruses and/or their associated diseases have changed remarkably in recent years, most notably with the invasion of Europe by multiple serotypes of BTV since 1998. Although not zoonoses, the unanticipated emergence of BT and EHD in several different areas of the world provides a uniquely sobering and unambiguous reminder of the potential consequences of climate change on the distribution and severity of vector-borne diseases. Recent experiences with these viruses have also emphasized the need for effective, DIVA-compatible vaccines to combat anticipated future incursions, as existing vaccines have serious inherent deficiencies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The multifunctional virion protein 35 (VP35) of ebolaviruses is a critical determinant of virulence and pathogenesis indispensable for viral replication and host innate immune evasion. Essential for VP35 function is homo-oligomerization via a coiled-coil motif. Here we report crystal structures of VP35 oligomerization domains from the prototypic Ebola virus (EBOV) and the non-pathogenic Reston virus (RESTV), together with a comparative biophysical characterization of the domains from all known species of the Ebolavirus genus. EBOV and RESTV VP35 oligomerization domains form bipartite parallel helix bundles with a canonical coiled coil in the N-terminal half and increased plasticity in the highly conserved C-terminal half. The domain assembles into trimers and tetramers in EBOV, whereas it exclusively forms tetramers in all other ebolavirus species. Substitution of coiled-coil leucine residues critical for immune antagonism leads to aberrant oligomerization. A conserved arginine involved in inter-chain salt bridges stabilizes the VP35 oligomerization domain and modulates between coiled-coil oligomeric states. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

abstract={The Shelter Quality protocol (SQP) is a concise and easily implemented tool for assessing dog welfare and to identify critical aspects of the shelter environment. A first version of the protocol has been modified to improve its performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the measures included in the second version of the protocol (SQP2) by testing the interobserver agreement between two independent assessors. We evaluated the sensitivity of animal-based measures in detecting the shelter dogs' welfare outputs during two different seasons. Ten Italian shelters were assessed contemporaneously by two assessors to determine the reliability of SQP2 measures. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using the Cohen's kappa for qualitative variables and Pearson’ correlation for quantitative variables. The SQP2 was also applied twice (January and August) by the same observer in five Italian shelters to evaluate the sensitivity of the protocol to seasonal condition changes. The quantitative variables, “Number of animals shivering/huddling” and “Number of animals panting” were analyzed by Wilcoxon test. Credible intervals (95%) were calculated using a beta distribution for qualitative variables: “Body condition”, “Skin condition”, “Dog cleanliness”, “Signs of diarrhea”, “Coughing”, and “Lameness”. The level of agreement between the two observers on the qualitative variables such as body condition, lameness, skin condition, was quite high, ranging from substantial (0.61–0.80) to almost perfect (0.81–0.99). Interobserver agreement was also significant with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.51 to 0.92 (e.g., curious = 0.74; sociable = 0.83; barking level = 0.61). “Number of animals panting” and “Signs of diarrhea” showed a significant difference between the assessments (P<0.05). The observations of animals with lameness, coughing, and inadequate body condition increased in the winter season, whereas the observations of animals with skin lesions increased during the summer, but not significantly. The behaviors of shivering/huddling were observed too infrequently to be meaningfully analyzed. Consistent interobserver agreement exists in assessing dogs' welfare using the SQP2 confirming the reliability of the measures included in the protocol. The SQP2 shows potential in detecting changes in dogs' welfare outputs due to different climatic conditions. Further investigations are required to confirm the sensitivity of selected measures to different seasons. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Expansion in global rabbit populations and in the number of rabbits raised for consumption necessitates assessment of the environmental impact and sustainability of rabbit production systems. This study undertook two evaluations: utilization (animal efficiency) of organic matter (OM) and nitrogen (N) produced from feed during rabbit fattening, and emission of ammonia (NH 3 ), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from rabbit manure during its storage and land application in laboratory-simulated conditions. Results demonstrated manure contained approximately 30 and 65% of the OM and N in the daily feed intake, respectively. Additionally, rabbit manure was shown to produce sizeable NH 3 and GHG emissions. Specifically, cumulative N losses from storage and subsequent land application averaged 32.4 (NH 3 ) and 2.2% (N 2 O) of excreted TN; cumulative proportions of OM lost as CO 2 and CH 4 averaged 51.3 and 0.4%, respectively. Finally, while manure incorporation into the soil effectively abated NH 3 emissions, it also showed its potential to increase N 2 O losses, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). Future research should focus on identifying appropriate emission mitigation measures. Accurate field-scale measurements are also needed to make data available for the development of a reliable national emission inventory of the investigated gases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sow mortality represents a relevant issue in the modern pig industry and can negatively impact the profitability of farming. Sow mortality rate should range between 3-6% on a yearly basis, but higher rates are quite commonly reported. Disease conditions of the locomotor, digestive, reproductive and urinary systems are most frequently observed in dead/euthanized sows. On the other hand, respiratory diseases are rare in this category of animals, the most severe episodes resulting from the introduction of a “new” infectious agent into the breeding stock, thus in absence of an adequate level of herd immunity. We describe herein the main clinical, pathological and microbiological findings observed during a severe outbreak of respiratory disease, which occurred in a breeding pig herd in Central Italy. The respiratory syndrome affected a very high percentage of pregnant and lactating sows (around 30%), both primiparous and multiparous. Within two weeks, the mortality rate reached 15%. At necropsy, serous-fibrinous pleuritis, along with large foci of acute bronchopneumonia, affecting the cranio-ventral parts of both lungs, represented the most relevant pathological findings in animals under study. In depth bacteriolog-ical investigations identified a capsular type D and hgbB-positive Pasteurella multocida strain as the sole causative agent. Pneumonic pasteurellosis usually affects grower/finishing pigs and represents the final stage of the so-called porcine respiratory disease complex. As a matter of fact, Pasteurella multocida rarely acts as the primary cause of porcine pneumonia, rather being considered an opportunist which complicates primary infections caused by other bacteria and/or viruses. The co-factors which likely contributed to determine such a severe respiratory syndrome in sows are largely unknown. Speculatively, we hy-pothesize that resulted from the introduction of a “new” strain of P. multocida, which infected immunologically naïve sows. The poor level of biosecurity adopted, as well as the kinetics of this outbreak, argue in favour of such a scenario. © 2019, Massimo Morgante. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary selenium supplementation of dairy cows on chemical–nutritional and aromatic properties of milk and related caciotta cheese. 34 Friesian cows were randomly assigned to two groups. The control group (CG) received a conventional feeding strategy, while the experimental group (EG) was fed with a daily selenomethionine supplementation. Dietary selenium integration did not induce variations on milk yield and composition, but induced a marked decrease in somatic cell count. Both in milk and cheese the EG samples showed an increase in linoleic and rumenic acids. The volatile profile of dairy products was also positively affected by dietary selenium intake, with a decrease in concentration of hexanoic acid, hexanal, heptanal, and an increase in ethyl hexanoate, δ-octalactone, δ-decalactone, 2-heptanone, and 2-nonanone. Such findings could contribute to the production of cheeses with interesting nutritional and organoleptic properties, although further sensorial evaluations should be performed to deeply investigate the consumer acceptability. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Anticipatory behaviour to an oncoming food reward can be triggered via classical conditioning, implies the activation of neural networks, and may serve to study the emotional state of animals. The aim of this study was to investigate how the anticipatory response to a food reward affects the cerebral cortex activity in sheep. Eight ewes from the same flock were trained to associate a neutral auditory stimulus (water bubble) to the presence of a food reward (maize grains). Once conditioned, sheep were trained to wait 15 s behind a gate before accessing a bucket with food (anticipation phase). For 6 days, sheep were submitted to two sessions of six consecutive trials each. Behavioural reaction was filmed and changes in cortical oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin concentration ([∆O 2 Hb] and [∆HHb] respectively) following neuronal activation were recorded by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Compared to baseline, during the anticipation phase sheep increased their active behaviour, kept the head oriented to the gate (Wilcoxon’s signed rank test; p ≤ 0.001), and showed more asymmetric ear posture (Wilcoxon’s signed rank test; p ≤ 0.01), most likely reflecting a learnt association and an increased arousal. Results of trial-averaged [∆O 2 Hb] and [∆HHb] within individual sheep showed in almost every sheep a cortical activation during the anticipation phase (Student T-test; p ≤ 0.05). The sheep showed a greater response of the right hemisphere compared to the left hemisphere, possibly indicating a negative affective state, such as frustration. Behavioural and cortical changes observed during anticipation of a food reward reflect a learnt association and an increased arousal, but no clear emotional valence of the sheep subjective experience. Future work should take into consideration possible factors affecting the accurateness of measures, such as probe’s location and scalp vascularization. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV; Paramyxoviridae) causes epizootic and interepizootic fatalities in odontocetes and mysticetes worldwide. Studies suggest there is different species-specific susceptibility to CeMV infection, with striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), and Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) ranking among the most susceptible cetacean hosts. The pathogenesis of CeMV infection is not fully resolved. Since no previous studies have evaluated the organ-specific immunopathogenetic features of CeMV infection in tissues from infected dolphins, this study was aimed at characterizing and comparing immunophenotypic profiles of local immune responses in lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen), lung and CNS in CeMV-molecularly (RT-PCR)-positive cetaceans from Western Mediterranean, Northeast-Central, and Southwestern Atlantic. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses targeted molecules of immunologic interest: caspase 3, CD3, CD20, CD57, CD68, FoxP3, MHCII, Iba1, IFNγ, IgG, IL4, IL10, lysozyme, TGFβ, and PAX5. We detected consistent CeMV-associated inflammatory response patterns. Within CNS, inflammation was dominated by CD3+ (T cells), and CD20+ and PAX5+ (B cells) lymphocytes, accompanied by fewer Iba1+, CD68+, and lysozyme+ histiocytes, mainly in striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins. Multicentric lymphoid depletion was characterized by reduced numbers of T cells and B cells, more pronounced in Guiana dolphins. Striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins often had hyperplastic (regenerative) phenomena involving the aforementioned cell populations, particularly chronically infected animals. In the lung, there was mild to moderate increase in T cells, B cells, and histiocytes. Additionally, there was a generalized increased expression of caspase 3 in lymphoid, lung, and CNS tissues. Apoptosis, therefore, is believed to play a major role in generalized lymphoid depletion and likely overt immunosuppression during CeMV infection. No differences were detected regarding cytokine immunoreactivity in lymph nodes, spleen, and lung from infected and non-infected dolphins by semiquantitative analysis; however, there was striking immunoreactivity for IFNγ in the CNS of infected dolphins. These novel results set the basis for tissue-specific immunophenotypic responses during CeMV infection in three highly susceptible delphinid species. They also suggest a complex interplay between viral and host's immune factors, thereby contributing to gain valuable insights into similarities, and differences of CeMV infection's immunopathogenesis in relation to body tissues, CeMV strains, and cetacean hosts. © 2019 Díaz-Delgado, Groch, Ressio, Riskallah, Sierra, Sacchini, Quesada-Canales, Arbelo, Fernàndez, Santos-Neto, Ikeda, Carvalho, Azevedo, Lailson-Brito, Flach, Kanamura, Fernandes, Cogliati, Centelleghe, Mazzariol, Di Renzo, Di Francesco, Di Guardo and Catão-Dias.

abstract={In 2018, Croatia reported the largest outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infections as well as the re-occurrence of human Usutu virus (USUV) infections. For the first time, fatal WNV and USUV infections were detected in wild birds. We analysed epidemiological characteristics and molecular epidemiology of WNV and USUV infections detected during 2018 transmission season. From April to November, 178 patients with neuroinvasive disease and 68 patients with febrile disease were tested for WNV and USUV. Viral RNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine samples using a real-time RT-PCR. Positive samples were tested by nested RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing. IgM/IgG antibodies were detected in serum/CSF samples using ELISA with confirmation of cross-reactive samples by virus neutralization test (VNT). WNV neuroinvasive disease was confirmed in 54 and WNV fever in seven patients from 10 continental Croatian counties. Areas affected in 2018 were those in which cases occurred in previous seasons, while in three areas human cases were reported for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis of six strains from patients residing in different geographic areas showed circulation of WNV lineage 2. In three patients, neuroinvasive USUV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR or VNT. Sequence analysis of one detected strain revealed USUV Europe 2 lineage. During the same period, a total of 2,574 horse and 1,069 poultry serum samples were tested for WNV antibodies using ELISA. Acute asymptomatic WNV infection (IgM antibodies) was documented in 20/0.7% horses. WNV IgG antibodies were found in 307/11.9% horses and in 125/12.7% poultry. WNV RNA was detected in two goshawks and USUV RNA was detected in one blackbird from north-western Croatia. In the Zagreb area, 3,670 female mosquitoes were collected. One Culex pipiens pool collected in July tested positive for USUV RNA. Our results highlight the importance of continuous multidisciplinary ‘One health’ surveillance of these emerging arboviruses. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Radionuclides are increasingly used in hospitals for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, such as functional research, diagnostic imaging, and in the performance of radioiodine therapy. Their use produces radioactive waste, and risks environmental contamination. The present study involves 486 samples of radioactive waste produced in hospitals in Abruzzo, Italy, during 2000 - 2015. Measurements were carried out with the gamma spectrometry technique: Germanium detector (PTG) with 8000 acquisition channels, power range 59 - 1836 keV, resolution 1 keV, overall efficiency 30%, measurement time 60000 Seconds. The radionuclides involved were as follows:  131I,  99mTc,   67Ga,   201Tl,   123I,   111In, with substantial activity in 44 samples. Checks allowed us to certify the levels of radioactive concentration in waste-water, plan for their suppression, and optimise the management procedures.},

Mortality rate among investigated population was 86,8% (118 dead out of 136). Twenty-seven carcasses were collected for macroscopic examination and screened for microbiological, virological, toxicological investigations. A sick mallard was captured and neurological symptoms were observed. No causative agent of viral avian diseases was found in the examined animals and screening for environmental neurotoxic substances proved negative as well. In contrast, microbiological cultures from specimens tested positive for botulinum toxin-producing clostridia. Blood serum and fecal extract of the sick mallard proved positive for botulinum neurotoxin in the standard mouse protection test using reference Clostridium botulinum type C antitoxin. Gene content of cultured strains showed a mosaic composition of bont/C and bont/D sequences, defining them as type C/D chimeric organisms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Mosquito-borne viruses are the cause of some of the greatest burdens to human health worldwide, particularly in tropical regions where both human populations and mosquito numbers are abundant. Due to a combination of anthropogenic change, including the effects on global climate and wildlife migration there is strong evidence that temperate regions are undergoing repeated introduction of mosquito-borne viruses and the re-emergence of viruses that previously were not detected by surveillance. In Europe, the repeated introductions of West Nile and Usutu viruses have been associated with bird migration from Africa, whereas the autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and dengue viruses has been driven by a combination of invasive mosquitoes and rapid transcontinental travel by infected humans. In addition to an increasing number of humans at risk, livestock and wildlife, are also at risk of infection and disease. This in turn can affect international trade and species diversity, respectively. Addressing these challenges requires a range of responses both at national and international level. Increasing the understanding of mosquito-borne transmission of viruses and the development of rapid detection methods and appropriate therapeutics (vaccines / antivirals) all form part of this response. The aim of this review is to consider the range of mosquito-borne viruses that threaten public health in Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, and the national response of a number of countries facing different levels of threat. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={Mass strandings of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are rare in the Mediterranean Sea. Nevertheless, in 2014 a pod of 7 specimens stranded alive along the Italian coast of the Central Adriatic Sea: 3 individuals died on the beach after a few hours due to internal damages induced by prolonged recumbency; the remaining 4 whales were refloated after great efforts. All the dead animals were genetically related females; one was pregnant. All the animals were infected by dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) and the pregnant whale was also affected by a severe nephropathy due to a large kidney stone. Other analyses ruled out other possible relevant factors related to weather conditions or human activities. The results of multidisciplinary post-mortem analyses revealed that the 7 sperm whales entered the Adriatic Sea encountering adverse weather conditions and then kept heading northward following the pregnant but sick leader of the pod, thereby reaching the stranding site. DMV infection most likely played a crucial role in impairing the health condition and orientation abilities of the whales. They did not steer back towards deeper waters, but eventually stranded along the Central Adriatic Sea coastline, a real trap for sperm whales. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Bluetongue (BT), caused by Bluetongue virus (BTV), is a disease that affects ruminants such as cattle, sheep, goats and deer. BTV is transmitted by female midges of the genus Culicoides. In Brazil, information on the prevalence of BTV in cattle is limited, so the objective of this work was to identify BTV serotypes in cattle. The State of São Paulo was divided into seven cattle-producing regions, and in each of them, 300 cattle farms were randomly selected. One animal from each farm (out of a total of 1,598 farms) was selected and its sera tested by virus neutralization technique against BTV serotypes (1–24 and 26) for determining antibody titre. Moreover, for each sampled farm, an epidemiological questionnaire was submitted to verify the type of cattle production and the zootechnical and sanitary practices carried out, which could be associated with a higher risk of BTV infection. In this study, antibodies (percentage, [95% confidence interval]) were identified against 11 serotypes: BTV-1 (22.15%, [15.72–27.92]), BTV-2 (31.03%, [26.65–37.98]), BTV-3 (18.96%, [12.42–24.90]), BTV-4 (24.90% [19.41–29.12]), BTV-9 (6.82%, [1.45–11.72]), BTV-12 (7.50%, [2.82–12.51]), BTV-17 (23.90%, [17.35–29.35]), BTV-19 (10.20%, [4.62–5.56]), BTV-21 (30.66%, [25.00–36.00]), BTV-22 (12.14%, [5.91–18.55]), BTV-26 (57.00%, [51.41–63.59]). In this study, for the first time in Brazil serological evidence of the presence of serotypes BTV-2, BTV-9, BTV-21 and BTV-26 is reported. The variable ‘new cattle entering herd’ was considered a risk factor for the occurrence of infection (OR = 2.183, 95% CI = 1.6–2.9). © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Grape pomace (GPO), the main by-product of the wine making process, is a rich source of polyphenols with potent antioxidant properties. Recently, GPO has emerged as a potential feed additive in livestock nutrition, with several reports describing its beneficial effects on animals’ overall health status or production traits. However, little is known about it from a molecular biology standpoint. In the present study, we report the first RNA sequencing-based whole-transcriptome profiling of Friesian calves fed with a GPO-supplemented diet. We identified 367 differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05) in the GPO-supplemented calves (n = 5), when compared with unsupplemented control group (n = 5). The pathway analysis showed that ‘cholesterol lipid biosynthesis’ was the most negatively-enriched (p < 0.001) pathway in the GPO-supplemented animals. In specific terms, five important genes coding for cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes, namely the Farnesyl-diphosphate Farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT-1), Squalene Epoxidase (SQLE), NAD(P)-dependent Steroid Dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL), Methylsterol Monooxygenase (MSMO)-1, and Sterol-C5-desaturase (SC5D), two major transcription factors (the Sterol Regulatory Element-binding Transcription Factor 1 and 2), as well as the Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR), were all downregulated following GPO supplementation. Such an effect was mirrored by a reduction of blood cholesterol levels (p = 0.07) and a lowered (p < 0.001) Malondialdehyde (lipid oxidation marker) level in carcasses. We provide evidence on the effects of GPO-supplemented diets on the whole-transcriptome signature in veal calves, which mainly reflects an antioxidant activity. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The endemic circulation of bovine brucellosis in cattle herds has a markedly negative impact on economy, due to decreased fertility, increased abortion rates, reduced milk and meat production. It also poses a direct threat to human health. In Italy, despite the long lasting efforts and the considerable economic investment, complete eradication of this disease still eludes the southern regions, as opposed to the northern regions that are disease-free. Here we introduced a novel quantitative network-based approach able to fully exploit the highly resolved databases of cattle trade movements and outbreak reports to yield estimates of the vulnerability of a cattle market to brucellosis. Tested on the affected regions, the introduced vulnerability indicator was shown to be accurate in predicting the number of bovine brucellosis outbreaks (Spearman r= 0.82, p= 0.04), thus confirming the suitability of our tool for epidemic risk assessment. We evaluated the dependence of regional vulnerability to brucellosis on a set of factors including premises spatial distribution, trading patterns, farming practices, herd market value, compliance to outbreak regulations, and exploring different epidemiological conditions. Animal trade movements were identified as a major route for brucellosis spread between farms (r=0.85, p&lt;10-5 between vulnerability and number of inbound movements), with an additional potential risk attributed to the use of shared pastures (r=0.4, p=0.04). By comparing the vulnerability of disease-free regions in the north to affected regions in the south, we found that more intense trade and higher market value of the cattle sector in the north (r=0.56, p=0.01) likely inducing more efficient biosafety measures, together with poor compliance to trade restrictions following outbreaks in the south were key factors explaining the diverse success in eradicating brucellosis. Our modeling scheme is both synthetic and effective in gauging regional vulnerability to brucellosis persistence. Its general formulation makes it adaptable to other diseases and host species, providing a useful tool for veterinary epidemiology and policy assessment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

In this study, the identification and genetic characterization of a bovine enterovirus (BEV) strain isolated from a calf with diarrhea, are described. Two different next generation sequencing platforms were employed. Shotgun metagenomic accomplished by MinION sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) allowed the identification of BEV RNA from a cell-culture isolate. BEV was then confirmed by a specific real time RT-PCR assay. To achieve the whole genome of this isolate, sequence reads obtained by MinION were coupled with those originating from NextSeq500 (Illumina). Genomic relatedness and phylogeny with extant BEV strains is also reported. Overall, this manuscript highlights the use of the portable MinION sequence technology as a tool for support diagnostics in veterinary practice. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Arboviruses can cause a variety of clinical signs, including febrile illness, arthritis, encephalitis, and hemorrhagic fever. The recent Zika epidemic highlighted the possibility that arboviruses may also negatively affect the male reproductive tract. In this study, we focused on bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of bluetongue and one of the major arboviruses of ruminants. We show that rams that recovered from bluetongue displayed signs of testicular degeneration and azoospermia up to 100 days after the initial infection. Importantly, testicular degeneration was induced in rams experimentally infected with either a high (BTV-1 IT2006 )- or a low (BTV-1 IT2013 )-virulence strain of BTV. Rams infected with the low-virulence BTV strain displayed testicular lesions in the absence of other major clinical signs. Testicular lesions in BTV-infected rams were due to viral replication in the endothelial cells of the peritubular areas of the testes, resulting in stimulation of a type I interferon response, reduction of testosterone biosynthesis by Leydig cells and destruction of Sertoli cells and the blood-testis barrier in more severe cases. Hence, BTV induces testicular degeneration and disruption of spermatogenesis by replicating solely in the endothelial cells of the peritubular areas unlike other gonadotropic viruses. This study shows that a naturally occurring arboviral disease can cause testicular degeneration and affect male fertility at least temporarily. IMPORTANCE During the recent Zika epidemic, it has become apparent that arboviruses could potentially cause reproductive health problems in male patients. Little is known regarding the effects that arboviruses have on the male reproductive tract. Here, we studied bluetongue virus (BTV), an arbovirus of ruminants, and its effects on the testes of rams. We show that BTV was able to induce testicular degeneration in naturally and experimentally infected rams. Testicular degeneration was caused by BTV replication in the endothelial cells of the peritubular area surrounding the seminiferous tubules (the functional unit of the testes) and was associated with a localized type I interferon response, destruction of the cells supporting the developing germinal cells (Sertoli cells), and reduction of testosterone synthesis. As a result of BTV infection, rams became azoospermic. This study highlights that problems in the male reproductive tract caused by arboviruses could be more common than previously thought. © 2018 Puggioni et al.},

abstract={The oomycete Aphanomyces astaci is the causative agent of crayfish plague in native European freshwater crayfish. Molecular analyses showed that several distinct genotype groups of this pathogen, apparently associated with different original host taxa, are present in Europe. Tracking their distribution may contribute to understanding the introduction pathways of A. astaci. We used microsatellite markers to genotype the pathogen strains involved in 7 mass mortalities of the endangered indigenous crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes that occurred between 2009 and 2016 in the Abruzzi and Molise regions, central Italy. Three A. astaci genotype groups (A, B, and D, with the latter represented by 2 distinct multilocus genotypes) were identified, suggesting the existence of multiple infection sources even in a relatively small area. Most crayfish plague episodes were due to genotype groups associated with the North American host species Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii, although these crayfish are not widespread in the study area. A. astaci genotype group A was detected not only in crayfish plague outbreaks but also in apparently healthy Astacus leptodactylus imported for human consumption from Armenia and kept alive in an aquaculture facility. Imports of chronically infected A. leptodactylus from Armenia, Turkey, and possibly Eastern Europe are an underestimated introduction pathway for A. astaci. Although we cannot exclude the presence of latently infected native populations of A. pallipes in the region, A. astaci infections in legally imported crayfish species considered vulnerable to crayfish plague may represent further reservoirs of A. astaci; this should be reflected in the policies regulating the trade of live crayfish. © Inter-Research 2018.},

abstract={Dourine is a parasitic venereal disease of equines caused by T. equiperdum. Humoral antibodies are found in infected animals, but diagnosis of dourine must include history, clinical, and pathological findings in addition to serology. Complement Fixation Test (CFT) is the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) recommended test for international trade; however, some uninfected equines may give inconsistent or nonspecific reactions in CFT due to the anticomplementary effects of their sera. In this study an Indirect Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (iELISA) was developed. This test could be used to confirm positive serological cases of dourine or to solve inconclusive results obtained by CFT, in addition to Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and a Chemiluminescent Immunoblotting Assay (cIB). Six-hundred-and-six CFT negative sera and 140 sera positive to CFT and IFAT were tested by iELISA using OVI T. equiperdum as antigen. Results were expressed as percentage of positivity and the optimum cut-off value determined sensitivity and specificity of 100%. All positive sera, tested by cIB, were confirmed as positive. Additionally, twenty seven sera, low-positive at CFT and negative by IFAT, were tested with iELISA and cIB. All samples resulted negative by cIB and one of them was positive in ELISA.

abstract={No data have been published on the use of infrared thermography (IRT) to evaluate sheep emotions. We assessed whether this technique can be used as a non-invasive measure of negative emotions. Two voluntary animal approach (VAA) tests were conducted (and filmed) on five ewes before and after being restrained. The restraining process was performed by a handler for five minutes. IRT was used during restraint and the VAA tests. The lacrimal caruncle temperature was significantly higher during restraint and in the VAA test after the restraint compared with the VAA test before the restraint (Wilcoxon’s test; p = 0.04). The latency period until first contact was longer in the second VAA test (132 s) than in the first one (60 s). Our preliminary results suggest that IRT, combined with behavioral data, is a non-invasive technique that can be useful to assess stress and infer about negative emotions in sheep. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has become a widely accepted method for microbiology laboratories in the application of molecular typing for outbreak tracing and genomic epidemiology. Several studies demonstrated the usefulness of WGS data analysis through single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling from a reference sequence analysis for Brucella melitensis, whereas gene-by-gene comparison through core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) has not been explored so far. The current study developed an allele-based cgMLST method and compared its performance to that of the genome-wide SNP approach and the traditional multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) on a defined sample collection. The data set was comprised of 37 epidemiologically linked animal cases of brucellosis as well as 71 isolates with unknown epidemiological status, composed of human and animal samples collected in Italy. The cgMLST scheme generated in this study contained 2,704 targets of the B. melitensis 16M reference genome. We established the potential criteria necessary for inclusion of an isolate into a brucellosis outbreak cluster to be 6 loci in the cgMLST and 7 in WGS SNP analysis. Higher phylogenetic distance resolution was achieved with cgMLST and SNP analysis than with MLVA, particularly for strains belonging to the same lineage, thereby allowing diverse and unrelated genotypes to be identified with greater confidence. The application of a cgMLST scheme to the characterization of B. melitensis strains provided insights into the epidemiology of this pathogen, and it is a candidate to be a benchmark tool for outbreak investigations in human and animal brucellosis. © 2018 Janowicz et al.},

abstract={Purpose. From May 2015 to March 2016, an outbreak due to Listeria monocytogenes serotype 1/2a and clinical pulsotype never previously isolated in Europe occurred in central Italy, involving 24 confirmed clinical cases. The article provides a description of the outbreak and the investigation carried out by a multidisciplinary network. Methodology. Epidemiological and microbiological surveillance was conducted to confirm the outbreak and to detect the food vehicle of infection. The origin and destination of the implicated food and its ingredients were investigated by tracing-back and-forward investigation. Results. Next-generation sequencing confirmed the unique outbreak strain. On 4 January 2016, a L. monocytogenes strain with pulsotype indistinguishable from that isolated from clinical cases in the outbreak was detected in a sample of hog head cheese purchased from a retail supermarket by one of the patients. The hog head cheese was produced by a small meat processing plant in the Marche region, where microbiological investigation confirmed environmental and food contamination by the outbreak strain. Plant production was suspended and all contaminated batches of the hog head cheese were withdrawn from the market by 19 February by local health authority. We subsequently observed a sharp decline in clinical cases, the last being reported on 11 March 2016. Conclusion. The key factor in the timely conclusion of this investigation was intersectoral collaboration among epidemiologists, microbiologists, veterinarians, statisticians and health and food safety authorities at national, regional and local levels. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Introduction: West Nile virus (WNV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies have been shown to persist for up to 500 days in certain patients. To evaluate the usefulness of immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity assessment in the diagnosis of WNV infection, we analyzed 54 WNV IgM- and/or IgG-positive serum samples from 39 patients with neuroinvasive disease and 15 asymptomatic cases tested during a seroprevalence investigation. Methods: Serological tests (WNV IgM/IgG antibody detection, IgG avidity) were performed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: WNV IgM antibodies were detected in 47 (87%) samples. Acute/recent WNV infection was confirmed based on low/borderline avidity index (AI) in 44 IgM-positive samples (93.6%). In three IgM-positive samples (6.4%), high IgG AIs were detected, thus indicating persisting IgM antibodies from previous infections. All IgM-negative samples showed high AIs. Patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease tested within 30 days showed low AIs. In six patients tested 34-50 days after disease onset, AI was borderline (42%-60%), suggesting earlier WNV IgG maturation. Samples with the highest IgM values were associated with the lowest AIs (Spearman's rho coefficient -0.767, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results indicate that IgG avidity differentiates current/recent WNV infection from persistent IgM seropositivity from the previous WNV transmission season both in patients with WNV neuroinvasive disease and in asymptomatic persons. A strong negative correlation between IgM antibody levels and AI indicates that in cases with very high IgM levels, determination of IgG avidity may not be necessary. As many patients showed rapid avidity maturation, low IgG avidity is indicative of WNV infection within the previous month. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Antimicrobial peptides have received great attention for their potential benefits to extend the shelf-life of food-products. Innate defense regulator peptide-1018 (IDR-1018) represents a promising candidate for such applications, due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, although food-isolated pathogens have been poorly investigated. Herein, we describe the design and the structural-functional characterization of a new 1018-derivative peptide named 1018-K6, in which the alanine in position 6 was replaced with a lysine. Spectroscopic analysis revealed a noticeable switch from β-sheet to helical conformations of 1018-K6 respect to IDR-1018, with a faster folding kinetic and increased structural stability. Moreover, 1018-K6 evidenced a significant antibiofilm/bactericidal efficiency specifically against Listeria monocytogenes isolates from food-products and food-processing environments, belonging to serotype 4b involved in the majority of human-listeriosis cases, with EC50 values two- five-fold lower than those measured for IDR-1018. Therefore, a single amino-acid substitution in IDR-1018 sequence produced severe changes in peptide conformation and antimicrobial performances. © 2018},

However, transplacental infection can occur and lead to abortion, malformations and stillborn lambs, calves and goat kids. During November and December 2014, malformations were observed in 11 stillborn calves from two farms in the north-eastern region of Namibia. Blood samples were collected from 9 of the 11 cows that delivered stillborn and malformed calves. All these animals tested negative for Rift Valley fever, bovine viral diarrhoea and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and were serologically positive for bluetongue virus, SBV and epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus. Clinical findings and serological results suggested that SBV may be circulating in Namibia. © 2018. The Authors.},

abstract={Background: In recent years, autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue became a promising approach to preserve female fertility. The slow freezing is the most effective technique which resulted in greater live birth incidence so far. Despite that, interest to vitrification of the ovarian tissue is swiftly growing, thereby undermining the necessity for further improvements in the technique. In present study, we evaluated possibilities to increase follicle survival rates adopting innovative multi-protectoral vitrification protocols, applied to the slivers of ovarian cortex or isolated early-antral follicles, frozen individually. These experimental protocols have been compared with with validated vitrification and slow freezing ones, clinically used for female fertility preservation. Results: The results showed that third tested variation of experimental vitrification protocol, with four cryoprotectants in relatively low concentrations and applied to pieces of ovarian tissue at 0 °C during equilibration, increased survival rate of ovine ovarian tissue and improved results in comparison with conventional vitrification method. This variation of experimental protocol showed significant increase in percentage of follicles with good morphology (69,3%) in comparison with only commercially available vitrification protocol for ovarian tissue (62,1%). Morphology results were confirmed by TUNEL assay. Analysis of estradiol and progesterone production by cultured individual follicles after freezing/thawing revealed that steroids secretion remained significantly higher after multi-protectoral vitrification and slow freezing protocol, when follicles after standard vitrification protocol demonstrated decline in steroidogenic activity. Conclusions: The multi-protectoral approach represents a workable solution to improve vitrification outcome on ovarian tissue and isolated follicles. The reduction of individual cryoprotectants concentrations, while maintaining their sufficient cumulative level in the final freezing solution, helps to increase efficiency of the procedure. Moreover, equilibration with lower temperatures helped to decrease even further the toxic effects of cryoprotectants and preserve original quality of ovarian tissue. Therefore, multi-protectoral vitrification can be suggested as an improved method for the clinical cryopreservation of ovarian tissue. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={A new method was developed for artificial contamination of food products during challenge test studies, in products where superficial contamination is needed. Rinds of Gorgonzola cheese wheels were divided into quarters and then squares with 12 cm of side and contaminated with absorbent paper soaked with a bacterial suspension of Listeria monocytogenes left in contact with the surface of the blue-veined cheese, in order to achieve homogenous contamination of the whole surface. To verify the performance of the method of contamination, after 24 hr L. monocytogenes was enumerated to evaluate surface contamination. With the method described, an average concentration of about 5 log10cfu/cm2 or MPN/cm2 was obtained starting from a contaminated suspension of 8 log10cfu/ml. The homogeneity of the contamination was demonstrated by the application of statistical tests. Practical applications: Challenge tests are carried out to simulate contaminations as they happen during the processing and aging of cheeses, cured meats or ready-to-eat foods, for cross contamination studies, for applications of predictive microbiology, and to evaluate potential dragging of bacteria during the cutting of slices. In all cases, the inoculum should be applied on the product using the appropriate technique, in order to mimic natural contamination. This study reports a new method of contamination that allows the achievement of homogeneous microbial distribution on the whole flat surface of foods, using absorbent paper soaked with a bacterial suspension of Listeria monocytogenes. It was tested in the framework of challenge tests aimed to quantify the dragging of bacteria from Gorgonzola cheese rinds to paste during different processing steps. The procedure could be, however, profitably used also in other food products, when uniform surface contamination is required. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to develop a real-time RT-PCR to detect and quantitate feline morbillivirus (FeMV) RNA in biological samples. Primers and probe were targeted on a conserved region of FeMV P/V/C gene. To validate the assay with field samples, a total number of specimens of cats have been recruited including 264 urine and blood samples and compared with a generic RT-PCR targeting the L protein encoding gene of morbilliviruses. In addition, 385 tissue samples from 35 carcasses of cats have been also employed. RNA titres were low in all tested samples. Results also indicated the absence of cross-reaction with related morbilliviruses and existing pathogens of cats. In tissues with low levels of FeMV RNA, the presence of viral antigen was also evidenced by immunohistochemistry targeting the N viral protein. This newly described assay allows for a rapid, accurate and reliable quantitative detection of FeMV RNA that can be applied for diagnostics and research studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this study, a new and alternative method based on monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for the rapid detection of Yersinia enterocolitica O:8 was developed. This microorganism is an emerging foodborne pathogen causing gastrointestinal disease in humans. The transmission can occur through contaminated food such as raw or undercooked meat, milk and dairy products, water and fresh vegetables. Nine MAbs (46F7, 54B11, 54C11, 62D10, 64C7, 64C10, 72E8, 72E10, 72G6) were characterized and selected versus Y. enterocolitica O:8, and only 2 of them showed also a weak cross-reaction with Campylobacter jejuni. The MAb 54B11 was used for the development of Y. enterocolitica capture-ELISA in food matrices, i.e. meat and dairy products (n = 132). The method was validated by ISO 16140:2003 and compared with the official method for the detection of presumptive pathogenic Y. enterocolitica (ISO 10273:2003). Relative accuracy, sensitivity and specificity corresponded to 100%. The selectivity was evaluated on other food samples (n = 126) showing a lower confidence limit of 90.3% and an upper confidence limit of 100%. The results from this study demonstrated that the developed method was rapid and cheap, specific and sensitive for the screening of the pathogen in food. © 2018},

A total of 125 samples diversely distributed in the 5 years of monitoring were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The method was validated according to Commission Decision 657/2002/EC with regard to the following parameters: linearity, specificity, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), recovery, and precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility). Even if the results of this study revealed no positive sample, the need for constant assurance of food safety and consumers' health protection requires the implementation of preventive as well as corrective actions in the management of risks linked to the food chain in a more global context.

abstract={Free-roaming dogs (FRDs) pose a significant health threat to humans, other animals and the environment. Yet, the effects of their movements and habitat use within cities and adjacent rural areas are poorly known, especially in relation to predation and the transmission of diseases that can impact human health (i.e., cystic echinococcosis and rabies). We explored the temporal and spatial distribution of owned FRDs for a remote Patagonian city surrounded by a grasslands rural ecosystem by superimposing GPS coordinates of tracked dogs on satellite images (Google map). Using logistic regressions, we evaluated the potential effect of age, body condition score (BCS) and distance from their initial recorded GPS fix (at or near the owner's home) to the rural boundary (RD) as predictors of home range (HR) and maximum distance (MD) travelled from home. Our study revealed that owned FRDs in Puerto Natales, Chile have a high site fidelity to the urban environment and especially their owneŕs home, seldom venturing into rural areas. We observed that even FRDs living in close proximity to the city boundary spent most of their time within the urban environment. On average, FRDs had a HR of 0.65 km2 (65 ha) and travelled a MD of 1.05 km. There were two individuals that travelled significantly further, and hence occupied a larger HR than the rest. Additionally, our results indicated that BCS was a predictor of HR, while age and RD were predictors of MD. These findings add to the range of predictors known to affect roaming dog HR size and used across different studies, suggesting that site-specific factors are likely affecting dog behavioral ecology. The study findings provide useful and original data on the movement ecology and site fidelity of owned FRDs in a remote city in Patagonia. We recommend that to make meaningful and cost-effective management decisions regarding owned FRDs in urban areas, future studies should also include the collection of sociocultural information on the interactions between of dogs and people. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The study summarises the results obtained over the period 2002-2013 by the Italian IT-Enter-Vet network, aimed at collecting data on Salmonella isolates from non-human sources. A total of 42,491 Salmonella isolates were reported with a progressive decrease over the years. S. Typhimurium was the most frequent serovar up to 2011, but then, it was overtaken by S. 4,[5],12,:i:-, S. Derby, S. Livingstone and S. Enteritidis alternated as the third most commonly isolated serovars. With regard to the sources of isolation, S. Typhimurium was distributed ubiquitously among the animal species. On the contrary, S. 4,[5],12,:i:- and S. Derby were strictly associated with pigs, whereas S. Livingstone, S. Enteritidis and S. Infantis were clearly related to poultry. Intriguingly, when the frequency of serovar distribution along the food chain was considered, it was evident that S. Typhimurium and S. Derby tended to persist along the chain, as they were isolated even more frequently from foods than from animals. A similar distribution was found for S. Enteritidis and S. Hadar. Despite limitations related to non-mandatory participation of laboratories in the network, the data presented are valuable to obtain a picture of the evolution of Salmonella from non-human sources over time in Italy. © British Veterinary Association (unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

abstract={Vibrio spp are widely distributed in the marine environments and are responsible for common illnesses in many countries. The main objective of this study was to investigate the depuration capacity of Venus gattina artificially contaminated with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus. Contamination experiments were used to assess the accumulation capacity of clams in poorly, moderate and highly contaminated waters (Vibrio spplO/ml, 10/mI, 10/ml). All bivalves were exposed to contamination for 72 h and 8 experiments were performed. Accumulation capacity varied with respect to initial level. Comparing experiments dataset with two vibrios species, clams showed a different specific accumulation: in particular, molluscs evidenced a scarce accumulation capacity of V.vulnificus. Depuration trials were performed in close-circuit seawater-disinfection system that uses filtration, Ultra violet (UV) and ozone. Bivalves samples were collected every 12h until 3 days of depuration. Most of the depuration trials with V.parahaemolyticus showed a decrease in initial bacterial loads (4times lower values) after36-48 hours, but in subsequent periods, the trend remained stationary. In V. vulnificus tests, clams showed a scarce depuration capacity instead. Future studies are still required to assess the efficacy of the depuration process in reducing pathogenic Vibrio strain naturally accumulated in clams and to prevent significant economic losses to stakeholders due to long depuration periods. © 2018 Chiriotti Editori.

abstract={Tritia mutabilis, formerly classified as Nassarius mutabilis, represents an important but declining resource for small scale fishery in the central Adriatic Sea, likely due to overfishing. A preliminary investigation on the use of artificial substrates to favour its spawning was carried out in a coastal area off the Abruzzi region, central Italy. Between May and June 2015, five groups of six pyramid structures made of a steel frame covered by plastic net, with a 0.5 m2 surface available for deposition, were placed on sandy bottoms at about 0.5 nautical miles from the coast and at sea depths ranging from 5.5 m to 7.5 m. A density of T. mutabilis egg capsules &gt; 1 per 100 cm2 was observed in two of the pyramid groups. The number of embryos present in each capsule ranged from 8 to 22 (mean number: 14). At the end of the study, almost all the capsules presented an apical opening and were empty, thus indicating successful hatching and larval release. This preliminary investigation shows that the natural deposition of T. mutabilis egg capsules can be facilitated by placing artificial substrates on sandy bottoms and it is conceivable that their use would contribute to maintain sustainable stocks of this species. © 2018, Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries.

abstract={Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, a severe respiratory disorder caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). The present study investigated the generation of ROS by different strains of Mmm, as well as their effect on the oxidative response of bovine neutrophils. The production of ROS was indirectly measured using a luminol-based chemiluminescence assay. Our results confirm that Mmm can produce ROS via the metabolism of glycerol, significant differences existing between African and European strains. Mmm was capable of adhering to the external surface of neutrophils. Interestingly, Mmm enhanced the respiratory burst of bovine neutrophils. This activity was particularly pronounced with the African field strain and in presence of glycerol. Taken together, our data argue in favour of a major role for neutrophils as the main source of ROS in contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Little is known about the role of traditional dairy products in naturally supplying beneficial microorganisms able to survive in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT). To investigate this aspect, a fresh artisanal Pasta Filata cheese was administered daily to 18 healthy children, 3–6 years of age, for seven days. Counts and type of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and propionic acid bacteria (PAB) were carried out on the cheese and children's faeces before and after cheese consumption. In most cases, statistically significant increases of presumptive LAB were observed after seven days from suspension compared to values before and at the end of consumption. Based on repetitive element palindromic PCR (rep-PCR) genotyping, six cheese isolates were identical to faecal isolates. Identity was confirmed by sequencing regions of clpP and rpoD genes for LAB and pepN and proW genes for PAB. Among those cheese isolates P. freudenreichii S-1-P, L. plantarum S-2-2 and L. helveticus S-2-6 stimulated the production of high interleukin 10 (IL-10) and low tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Therefore they could exert anti-inflammatory effects in vivo. Results suggested that traditional dairy products should be more efficiently exploited as a natural source of health-promoting microorganisms. © 2018},

abstract={The virulence gene profile of 26 rabbit enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains, isolated from 17 colibacillosis outbreaks located in two regions of Northern Italy, was determined using an Echerichia coli virulence DNA microarray. All strains were classified according to their determined biotype, sero-and phylo-group. The distribution of virulence genes encoding for the Locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), LEE type III secretion system (T3SS), non-LEE T3SS translocated proteins and adherence factors was also determined. All strains but one belonged to phylogroups A and B1. A prevalent association between the O103 serogroup with the rhamnose-negative phenotype (biotype 12 or 14) was found. The most prevalent LEE profile found in tested strains was ler/cesT/espA-1/espB-3/tir-1/eae(beta)/espD-2/escN/eprJ. All strains possessed either the adhesive factor rabbit-2 (afr/2) or the plasmid Rabbit adherence locus (ral) gene and 24 of them an additional individual or combined set of colonization factors efa1/lifA, lpfA and paa genes. Finally, the combined or single presence of a set of LEE and/or non-LEE effector proteins encoding genes, namely espG, cif, map and nle family genes, attested to the genetic potential of investigated strains to induce pathologic lesions to the host. The application of microarray-based technologies in assessing the genetic profile of rabbit E. coli is a reliable, cost-effective candidate for large scale investigations in monitoring programs aimed to survey the circulation of pathogenic strains within rabbit production units, their zoonotic genetic potential and to select E. coli strains eligible for vaccinal prophylaxis in fattening rabbit production. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Background: The Avian Influenza A (H5N1) virus is endemic in poultry in Egypt. The winter of 2014/2015 was particularly worrying as new clusters of HPAI A (H5N1) virus emerged, leading to an important number of AI A (H5N1) outbreaks in poultry farms and sporadic human cases. To date, few studies have investigated the distribution of HPAI A (H5N1) outbreaks in Egypt in relation to protective / risk factors at the farm level, a gap we intend to fill. The aim of the study was to analyse passive surveillance data that were based on observation of sudden and high mortality of poultry or drop in duck or chicken egg production, as a basis to better understand and discuss the risk of HPAI A (H5N1) presence at the farm level in large parts of the Nile Delta. Results: The probability of HPAI A (H5N1) presence was associated with several characteristics of the farms. Vaccination status, absence of windows/openings in the farm and the number of birds per cycle of production were found to be protective factors, whereas the presence of a duck farm with significant mortality or drop in egg production in the village was found to be a risk factor. Conclusions: Results demonstrate the key role of several prevention and biosecurity measures to reduce HPAI A (H5N1) virus circulation, which could promote better poultry farm biosecurity in Egypt. © 2018 The Author(s)..},

abstract={Culicoides biting midges can transmit viruses such as bluetongue virus and Schmallenberg virus to ruminants and African horse sickness virus to equines. The control of Culicoides population can be based on physical and/or chemical methods. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of larvicides and adulticides combined treatments to control the vector Culicoides populations. Field trials have been conducted during 2014 on seven farms in northern Sardinia (Italy). Three insecticide treatments (larvicides and adulticides) have been carried out on three farms, whereas four farms remained unsprayed as untreated controls. For the larval control two commercial formulations, based on diflubenzuron and Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (H-14), have been used. Against adults a deltamethrin based product has been sprayed on the walls and roofs of animal shelters. Adult Culicoides have been collected on each farm twice a week with an Onderstepoort blacklight suction trap. After each treatment a significant reduction in the abundance of total Culicoides, C. imicola and C. newsteadi s.l., has been observed. The Obsoletus complex density has been affected by the first two treatments. Our results suggest the possibility to control the Culicoides populations with a combination of adulticide and larvicide treatments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The implementation of the European Union strategy for polychlorodibenzo-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) is determining a general reduction of their presence in the environment and in the food chain. The most important route for human exposure to these substances is food consumption and, as a consequence, a progressive decrease of their dietary intake has been observed in the last decades. In this context, it seemed worth updating the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake estimation for the Italian population. A total of 2659 samples of food of animal and vegetable origin analyzed for PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs in the period 2013–2016 by accredited official laboratories and the national food consumption database were considered for the dietary intake assessment in different age groups of the Italian general population The median cumulative intake estimates expressed as pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day and computed with a deterministic and a probabilistic approach were 1.40–1.52 for children, 0.82–0.85 for adolescents, and 0.64–0.61 for adults, respectively. Such results confirm the decreasing trend of PCDD/F and DL-PCB dietary intake even though the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value of 2 WHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day is exceeded at the 95th percentile for all age groups, with children as sensitive group. Most contributing food categories to the intake resulted fish, food of vegetable origin, and cheese. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to calculate the target contamination levels able to keep the dietary exposure below the TDI. Computed target levels fall between P50 and P97 of the occurrence distribution of the main food groups, meaning that most of the Italian food production can be considered safe. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Caliciviruses of the Sapovirus genus have been recently detected in dogs. Canine sapoviruses (SaVs) have been identified in the stools of young or juvenile animals with gastro-enteric disease at low prevalence (2.0–2.2%), but whether they may have a role as enteric pathogens and to which extent dogs are exposed to SaVs remains unclear. Here, we report the expression in a baculovirus system of virus like-particles (VLPs) of a canine SaV strain, the prototype virus Bari/4076/2007/ITA. The recombinant antigen was used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). By screening an age-stratified collection of serum samples from 516 dogs in Italy, IgG antibodies specific for the canine SaV VLPs were detected in 40.3% (208/516) of the sera. Also, as observed for SaV infection in humans, we observed a positive association between seropositivity and age, with the highest prevalence rates in dogs older than 4 years of age. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background In the last decades an increasing number of West Nile Disease cases was observed in equines and humans in the Mediterranean basin and surveillance systems are set up in numerous countries to manage and control the disease. The collection, storage and distribution of information on the spread of the disease becomes important for a shared intervention and control strategy. To this end, a Web Geographic Information System has been developed and disease data, climatic and environmental remote sensed data, full genome sequences of selected isolated strains are made available. This paper describes the Disease Monitoring Dashboard (DMD) web system application, the tools available for the preliminary analysis on climatic and environmental factors and the other interactive tools for epidemiological analysis. Methods WNV occurrence data are collected from multiple official and unofficial sources. Whole genome sequences and metadata of WNV strains are retrieved from public databases or generated in the framework of the Italian surveillance activities. Climatic and environmental data are provided by NASA website. The Geographical Information System is composed by Oracle 10g Database and ESRI ArcGIS Server 10.03; the web mapping client application is developed with the ArcGIS API for Javascript and Phylocanvas library to facilitate and optimize the mash-up approach. ESRI ArcSDE 10.1 has been used to store spatial data. Results The DMD application is accessible through a generic web browser at https://netmed.izs.it/ networkMediterraneo/. The system collects data through on-line forms and automated procedures and visualizes data as interactive graphs, maps and tables. The spatial and temporal dynamic visualization of disease events is managed by a time slider that returns results on both map and epidemiological curve. Climatic and environmental data can be associated to cases through python procedures and downloaded as Excel files. Conclusions The system compiles multiple datasets through user-friendly web tools; it integrates entomological, veterinary and human surveillance, molecular information on pathogens and environmental and climatic data. The principal result of the DMD development is the transfer and dissemination of knowledge and technologies to develop strategies for integrated prevention and control measures of animal and human diseases. © 2018 Savini et al.

abstract={Considering the importance of honey bees for pollination activity and biodiversity preservation different studies have dealt with the impact of pesticides on honeybee health. Within the hive, beeswax is a matrix of particular interest because most of the chemicals used in agricultural and beekeeping activities can easily accumulate and persist in this matrix long after treatment has ceased, affecting honeybees survival. However, chemical analyses of pesticide residues in beeswax are not mandatory, so there are no residue limits, for beeswax. The present study was carried out with the aim of investigating the beeswax residue pattern in the Italian hives. 178 beeswax samples collected from 2013 to 2015 were analyzed for 247 pesticides. 73.6% of the analyzed samples reported the presence of one or more pesticides. On average every single sample showed a mean of three different pesticides each with a maximum of fourteen compounds, some of which were banned in Europe or not authorized in Italy. The higher frequencies were associated with three acaricides: coumaphos (60.7% of samples), tau-fluvalinate (50%) and chlorphenvinphos (35.4%), but the higher concentrations were associated to pyrethrins and piperonil butoxide. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Brucellosis is essentially a disease of domesticated livestock; however, humans can also be infected via the consumption of contaminated meat or dairy products, underlying the need for rapid and accurate identification methods. Procedures for microbiological identification and typing of Brucella spp. are expensive, time-consuming, and must be conducted in biohazard containment facilities to minimize operator risk. The development of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)-based assay has reduced the processing time while maintaining performance standards. In this study, to improve the identification accuracy and suitability of the MALDI-TOF-based assay for routine diagnosis, we developed a new protein extraction protocol and generated a custom reference database containing Brucella strains representative of the most widespread species. The reference library was then challenged with blind-coded field samples isolated from infected animals. The results indicated that the database could be used to correctly identify 99.5% and 97% of Brucella strains at the genus and species level, respectively, indicating that the performance of the assay was not affected by the different culture conditions used for microbial isolation. Moreover, the inactivated samples were stored and shipped to reference laboratories with no ill effect on protein stability, thus confirming the reliability of our method for routine diagnosis. Finally, we evaluated the epidemiological value of the protocol by comparing the clustering analysis results of Brucella melitensis strains obtained via multiple locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis or MALDI-TOF MS. The results showed that the MALDI-TOF assay could not decipher the true phylogenetic tree, suggesting that the protein profile did not correspond with the genetic evolution of Brucella. © 2018 Sali et al.

abstract={A study was conducted to investigate the seroprevalence and associated risk factors of Chlamydia abortus infection in cattle and some selected wildlife species at selected interface areas at the periphery of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area in Zimbabwe. Three study sites were selected based on the type of livestock–wildlife interface, porous livestock–wildlife interface (unrestricted), non-porous livestock–wildlife interface (restricted by fencing), and livestock–wildlife non-interface (totally absent or control). Sera were collected from cattle aged ≥ 2 years representing both female and intact male. Sera were also collected from selected wild ungulates from Mabalauta (porous interface) and Chipinda Pools (non-interface) areas of the Gonarezhou National Park. Sera were tested for antibodies to Chlamydia abortus using a CFT. A X 2 test was used to assess differences between categories and p &lt; 0.05 was considered as significant. In cattle, the overall seroprevalence was 32.7% (327/1011; 95% CI 29.5–35.3). A significantly lower seroprevalence was recorded for the porous interface (24.2%) compared to the non-porous (42.5%) (p &lt; 0.0001) and the non-interface (36.2%) (p = 0.001). Overall, the wet season recorded a significantly (p = 0.015) higher seroprevalence than the dry season. In wildlife, antibodies were detected in buffaloes (47.7%) and impalas (43.8%) but not in kudus. Buffaloes from Chipinda Pools (53.4%) had a significantly (p = 0.036) higher seroprevalence than those from Mabalauta (26.1%). The results established the presence of chlamydiosis in cattle and selected wildlife and that independent infections may be maintained in buffalo populations.

abstract={Background: As the epidemiology of human Q Fever generally reflects the spread of Coxiella burnetii in ruminant livestock, molecular characterization of strains is essential to prevent human outbreaks. In this study we report the genetic diversity of C. burnetii in central Italy accomplished by MST and MLVA-6 on biological samples from 20 goat, sheep and cow farms. Results: Five MST and ten MLVA profiles emerged from the analysis establishing a part of C. burnetii strain world atlas. In particular, ST32 occurred on 12 farms (60%), prevalently in goat specimens, while ST12 (25%) was detected on 4 sheep and 1 goat samples. ST8 and a variant of this genotype were described on 2 different sheep farms, whereas ST55 was observed on a goat farm. Five complete MLVA profiles different from any other published genotypes were described in this study in addition to 15 MLVA incomplete panels. Despite this, polymorphic markers Ms23, Ms24 and Ms33 enabled the identification of samples sharing the same MST profile. Conclusions: Integration of such data in international databases can be of further help in the attempt of building a global phylogeny and epidemiology of Q fever in animals, with a "One Health" perspective. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={The identification of field mice Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, and Apodemus alpicola represents a challenge for field scientists due to their highly overlapping morphological traits and habitats. Here, we propose a new fast real-time PCR method to discriminate the three species by species-specific TaqMan assays. Primers and probes were designed based on the alignment of 54 cyt-b partial sequences from 25 different European countries retrieved from GenBank. TaqMan assays were then tested on 133 samples from three different areas of Italy. Real-time PCR analysis showed 92 samples classified as A. flavicollis, 13 as A. sylvaticus, and 28 as A. alpicola. We did not observe any double amplification and DNA sequencing confirmed species assignment obtained by the TaqMan assays. The method is implementable on different matrices (ear tissues, tail, and blood). It can be used on dead specimens or on alive animals with minimally invasive sampling, and given the high sensitivity, the assay may be also suitable for degraded or low-DNA samples. The method proved to work well to discriminate between the species analyzed. Furthermore, it gives clear results (amplified or not) and it does not require any postamplification handling of PCR product, reducing the time needed for the analyses and the risk of carryover contamination. It therefore represents a valuable tool for field ecologists, conservationists, and epidemiologists. © 2018 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Background: For over sixty years, it has been known that mammalian spermatozoa immediately after ejaculation are virtually infertile. They became able to fertilize only after they reside for long time (hours to days) within female genital tract where they complete their functional maturation, the capacitation. This process is finely regulated by the interaction with the female environment and involves, in spermatozoa, a myriad of molecules as messengers and target of signals. Since, to date, a model able to represent the molecular interaction that characterize sperm physiology does not exist, we realized the Human Sperm Interactme Network3.0 (HSIN3.0) and its main component (HSNI3.0_MC), starting from the pathway active in male germ cells. Results: HSIN3.0 and HSIN3.0_MC are scale free networks, adherent to the Barabasi-Albert model, and are characterised by an ultra-small world topology. We found that they are resistant to random attacks and that are designed to respond quickly and specifically to external inputs. In addition, it has been possible to identify the most connected nodes (the hubs) and the bottlenecks nodes. This result allowed us to explore the control mechanisms active in driving sperm biochemical machinery and to verify the different levels of controls: party vs. date hubs and hubs vs. bottlenecks, thanks the availability of data from KO mice. Finally, we found that several key nodes represent molecules specifically involved in function that are thought to be not present or not active in sperm cells, such as control of cell cycle, proteins synthesis, nuclear trafficking, and immune response, thus potentially open new perspectives on the study of sperm biology. Conclusions: For the first time we present a network representing putative human sperm interactome. This result gives very intriguing biological information and could contribute to the knowledge of spermatozoa, either in physiological or pathological conditions. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={This study aimed to isolate, define the genetic profile, assess potential pathogenicity and evaluate the seasonal distribution of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus strains isolated from the Vibrata river (Abruzzo Region, Italy) during a monitoring period of one year. Detection was performed according to ISO/TS 21872-1-2:2007. Species identification and characterisation were achieved using molecular methods. Vibrio spp. were detected in 50% (23) of the water samples. In particular, V. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus were isolated in 18 (39.1%), 4 (8.7%), and 2 (4.3%) samples, respectively. All V. parahaemolyticus strains were tdh gene negative, 75% were positive for trh gene. In 30 V. cholerae isolates, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for detecting virulence and regulatory genes (ctxA, toxR, tcpA, ompU, hlyA, tcpI, zot, and stn/sto) revealed 6 genotypes associated to different levels of pathogenicity. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) characterisation of the V. cholerae strains identified 13 different pulsotypes. A greater degree of similarity was shown for strains isolated in the same period of the year. Results of our study reveal a potential health risk associated with the waters of the Vibrata river, which are used for irrigation and next to the swimming areas of Abruzzo coastline. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Widely spread in nature, Yersinia enterocolitica (YE) is a foodborne pathogen of major health and economic significance in developed countries. The aim of this study is to analyse YE strains isolated from 400 slaughtered pigs from the Abruzzo region, Italy, using biochemical tests and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction PCR detecting 6 chromosomal genes (ystA, irp2, 16s, ail, inv, hemR) and one plasmid-borne virulence gene (yadA). Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was also performed in order to assess phylogenetic diversity. In total, 56 samples of porcine tonsils (14%) were found to be positive for the presence of pathogenic YE. All YE belonged to the pathogenic bioserotype 4/O:3. All YE samples were positive for the chromosomal virulence genes ystA, ail, and inv, whereas results for the presence of yadA and hemR were variable. This study found that YE isolates were resistant to ampicillin (100%), streptomycin (26.79%), sulfisoxazole (19.65%), tetracycline (16.08%), nalidixic acid (14.30%), and chloramphenicol (10.72%). The strains characterised by PFGE showed a high similarity. This study demonstrates the usefulness of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) compared with conventional phenotypic assays for the identification of pathogenic YE isolates and the limitations of PFGE for the molecular typing of YE bioserotype 4/O:3. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Reproductive disorders are responsible for significant economic losses in canary aviculture due to embryo and newborn chick mortality. Most of the time, deaths are caused by bacterial pathogens, however little published data exist about the prevalence of bacterial isolates that are identified during diagnostic protocols. This study reports on data collected from previous investigations carried out on cloacal swabs (n 456), unhatched eggs (n 52), and dead newborn chicks (n 68) collected from canary aviaries with a history of reproductive disorders. Of the examined samples, 41% were positive for the presence of pathogenic or potentially pathogenic bacteria, with particular regard to Gram negative species during bacteriological investigations. The most prevalent microorganisms were Gram-negative (55%). A predominance of Klebsiella, Escherichia, and Pantoea genera was observed. These are usually associated to pathological conditions in pet birds. Among Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were most prevalent. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing carried out on bacterial isolates showed a multiple resistance, especially against amoxycillin, erythromycin, spiramycin, tiamulin, and tylosin. This study represents a first attempt to provide an update on microbial causes of embryonic and neonatal mortality in canary aviaries in Italy; in addition, it provides further understandings about the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={According to European Union (EU) regulations, the serological tests for the eradication of bovine and ovine brucellosis are the Rose Bengal Test, Complement Fixation Test, and i-ELISA. These methods, also recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for international trades, have limitations related to the use of suspensions of smooth Brucellae or LPS extracts. Limitations include false-positive serological reactions to brucellosis, which in turn impedes accurate diagnosis in some herds. False positive reactions should be considered carefully during the final stages of an eradication programme and for surveillance purposes in brucellosis-free areas. In this study, we produced specific sera through the experimental infection of sheep with Y. enterocolitica O:9 and E. coli O157:H7. These are the most important cross-reactive bacteria with Brucella. We then evaluated the antibody response of groups of sheep that had been immunised towards homologous antigens and official antigens for brucellosis, in order to identify a differential diagnostic protocol to distinguish cross-reaction in Brucella-infected animals. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Pteropine Orthoreoviruses (PRVs) are fusogenic bat-borne orthoreoviruses that cause flu-like upper respiratory tract infections in humans. The presence of this group of viruses in bats and humans has been well documented in areas where their biological reservoirs – fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) – live densely. In the present study, a serum neutralization (SN) assay to detect neutralizing antibodies against PRV Indonesia/2010 isolate was set up and used to assess the seroprevalence of this virus in Italian domestic animals. The new developed assay was able of detecting PRV neutralizing antibodies in the hyper-immune polyclonal serum produced in rabbits (titer of 1:160). The negative serum was negative at all tested dilutions. No cross-reactions have been evidenced neither against reference MRVs nor against their respective hyper-immune sera. Eight hundred and fifty-three serum samples collected from 524 bovines, 271 small ruminants, and 58 horses (all used as sentinel animals in the Bluetongue and West Nile disease National surveillance program) were also tested with the new developed SN assay. According to the results of this survey, neither PRV nor PRV cross-reacting viruses antibodies have been demonstrated in Italian domestic animals. However, the new developed SN assay could be a very valuable diagnostic tool to detect infection in animals and humans. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Several factors influence bacteria biodiversity in hot springs. The impact of biotic and abiotic pathways on travertine deposition plays a key role in microbial ecology and in the final composition of the waterborne microbiota. The metabolism of some bacterial groups such as photoautotrophs or lithoautotrophs influences water chemistry, favoring carbonate precipitation processes. The role of microbial mats in mineral precipitation processes is not fully clarified. For the first time, a comprehensive metagenomic analysis has been undertaken in the historical Bullicame hot spring. Bacterial biodiversity was characterized and biomineralization activities were assigned to different genera. A higher biodiversity in mat samples compared to water samples was observed: Shannon index of 3.34 and 0.86, respectively. Based on the functional assignment of each Operational Taxonomic Unit, the bacteria involved in biologically-induced mineralization are prevalent in mat and released in the water. According to the principle that each geothermal water specimen has distinctive physic-chemical characteristics, our results suggest new interacting bio-actions within these ecosystems. The saturation index and the chemical composition, as the high concentration of sulfur species and HCO 3 , can be linked to create a selective environment where pioneer communities are able to live and shape the ecosystem. © 2018 by EDIMES - Edizioni Internazionali Srl.

abstract={Bluetongue (BT), is one of the OIE-listed major diseases of ruminants. Following the official report of BT virus serotype 3 (BTV-3) in a sheep in Cap Bon (Tunisia), blood and serum samples of ruminants were collected from some areas of Tunisia to further investigate the presence of this virus in the country. A quantitative real time RT-PCR has been first developed for the detection and quantitation of BTV-3 RNA from field specimens. Out of 62 collected blood samples, 23 were shown to be positive for BTV-3 RNA. Isolation on cell cultures was also possible from six samples. Genome sequencing revealed the circulation of two unrelated western strains of BTV-3, one circulating in Cap Bon and neighboring areas, and the other circulating nearby the border with Libya. The presence of a putative novel BTV serotype (BTV-Y TUN2017) in sheep introduced from Libya to Tunisia, genomically related to the BTV strain contaminating a commercially-available sheep pox vaccine and to BTV-26, has been also demonstrated. This finding highlights the pressing need for a prompt production and release of a novel inactivated BTV-3 vaccine to be used in case of emergence or proactively in the areas of Southern Europe at major risk of BTV introduction. The assessment of a novel vaccine will certainly exalt the role and importance of surveillance activities and collaboration with Northern African countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) causes neonatal mortality and reproductive failure in goats. Despite its impact on herd reproductive performance, few studies have investigated the risk factors associated with CpHV-1 infection. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify potential herd- and host-level risk factors associated with CpHV-1 prevalence in a goat population with heterogeneous seropositivity for CpHV-1. Results: Blood samples and individual data from 4542 goats were collected from 255 herds in Piedmont, Italy. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and serum neutralization tests were carried out to detect antibodies against CpHV-1. A mixed-effects model was applied to identify any statistical association between CpHV-1 seropositivity and a set of putative host-level and herd-level risk factors. A total of 630 samples tested were found positive by ELISA (prevalence = 13.9%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-14.9). Of the 255 tested herds, 85 were classified as positive for the presence of at least one gB-positive animal (herd prevalence 33.3%, 95% CI 27.5-39.2), with a within-herd prevalence between 0.7 and 100% (Q1 = 17.6%; median = 32.3%; Q3 = 50%) (Q = quartiles). The prevalence ratios showed a statistical association with the following risk factors: breeds other than Saanen, older age, larger herd size, meat and extensive herds, and co-existence of CAEV-infected animals. Conclusions: Results from this cross sectional study may help to elucidate the natural history of the infection and inform targeted strategies to control a disease with a potentially important impact on animal health and goat farming economy. © 2018 The Author(s).},

We carried out epidemiological, microbiological and traceback investigations to identify the source. The people affected were students and staff members from two different schools in two different villages located in the Province of Turin; five of them were hospitalised. The epidemiological investigation identified a cooked beef ham served at the school canteens as the source of the food-borne outbreak. L. monocytogenes was isolated from the food, the stools of the hospitalised pupils and the environment of the factory producing the cooked beef ham. All isolates except one were serotype 1/2a, shared an indistinguishable PFGE pattern and were 100% identical by whole genome sequencing (WGS). By combining a classical epidemiological approach with both molecular subtyping and WGS techniques, we were able to identify and confirm a Listeria gastroenteritis outbreak associated with consumption of sliced cold beef ham. © 2018, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={The diagnosis of dourine can be difficult because the clinical signs of this disease in horses are similar to those of surra, caused by Trypanosoma evansi. Moreover, T. equiperdum and T. evansi are closely related and, so far, they cannot be distinguished using serological tests. In a previous work, the T. equiperdum protein pattern recognized by antibodies from dourine-infected horses and the humoral immune response kinetics were investigated by immunoblotting assay; a total of 20 sera from naturally and experimentally infected horses and from healthy animals were tested. Immunoblotting analysis showed that antibodies from infected horses specifically bind T. equiperdum low molecular weight proteins (from 16 to 35 kDa), which are not recognized by antibodies from uninfected horses. In this work, we tested other 615 sera (7 from naturally infected horses and 608 sera from healthy horses and donkeys): results confirmed the data obtained previously. In addition, six SDS-PAGE bands with molecular weight ranging from 10 to 37 kDa were analyzed by mass spectrometry, in order to identify immunogenic proteins that could be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis of dourine.

abstract={Vegetables that can be eaten raw in salads are considered at higher risk for contamination by foodborne pathogens and pesticide residues. In this study fresh leafy green vegetables, both pre-cut and uncut, were sampled at retail in all 20 Italian regions and tested for pathogens and pesticide residues contamination. Both in pre-cut and in uncut vegetables 1.00% of samples tested positive for pathogens investigated. Pesticide residues were detected in 53.33% of samples, pre-cut vegetables were more often contaminated (59.06%) than uncut vegetables (47.68%). Samples tested positive from one (monoresidual samples, 27.33%) to seven chemical compounds (multiresidual samples, 26.00%). Maximum Residual Levels (MRL) established by European legislation were exceeded in two multiresidual samples of uncut romaine lettuce (overall non-compliant prevalence 0.67%). A few samples resulted non-compliant for MRL or contaminated by pathogens. Nevertheless in more than half of the samples analysed pesticide residues were found; furthermore vegetables encompassed in this survey are eaten raw and process does not include any effective microbial elimination step. These findings can suggest that public health risk remains, especially regarding pre-cut vegetables. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Antibiotic resistance occurs in the endogenous flora of exposed population in addition to pathogenic bacteria. This study was conducted to evaluate the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes among 63 isolates of Escherichia coli of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in diarrheic calves and poultry. According to the results, B1 and B2 were the most prevalent phylogroups of E. coli in calves and poultry carcasses, respectively. Antimicrobial resistance was observed in 76% of the isolates, and 62% of the strains were multi-drug resistant. Antibiotic resistance in E. coli strains obtained from calves strains was significantly higher than those obtained from poultries. Additionally, the strains of B1 and D phylogroups had the highest and lowest antimicrobial resistance, respectively. At least one encoding gene for integrone was detected in 23 strains (36.5%) and Class I integron had the highest prevalence. Accordingly, this study gave baseline information on the magnitude of the resistance problem and its genetic background in E. coli from domesticated animals of the Tehran, Iran. Moreover, the power of oligonucleotide array technology in the discrimination of different genotypes during a short time was confirmed in this study. © 2018 by Razi Vaccine & Serum Research Institute.},

abstract={Cell-based therapy holds great promise for tendon disorders, a widespread debilitating musculoskeletal condition. Even if the cell line remains to be defined, preliminary evidences have proven that amniotic-derived cells possess in vitro and in vivo a great tenogenic potential. This study investigated the efficacy of transplanted human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) by testing their early regenerative properties and mechanisms involved on a validated ovine Achilles tendon partial defect performed on 29 animals. The injured tendons treated with hAECs recovered rapidly, in 28 days, structural and biomechanical properties undertaking a programmed tissue regeneration, differently from the spontaneous healing tissues. hAECs remained viable within the host tendons establishing with the endogenous progenitor cells an active dialogue. Through the secretion of modulatory factors, hAECs inhibited the inflammatory cells infiltration, activated the M2 macrophage subpopulation early recruitment, and accelerated blood vessel as well as extracellular matrix remodelling. In parallel, some in situ differentiated hAECs displayed a tenocytelike phenotype. Both paracrine and direct hAECs stimulatory effects were confirmed analysing their genome profile before and after transplantation. The 49 human up-regulated transcripts recorded in transplanted hAECs belonged to tendon lineage differentiation (epithelial–mesenchymal transition, connective specific matrix components, and skeleton or muscle system development-related transcripts), as well as the in situ activation of paracrine signalling involved in inflammatory and immunomodulatory response. Altogether, these evidences support the hypothesis that hAECs are a practicable and efficient strategy for the acute treatment of tendinopathy, reinforcing the idea of a concrete use of amniotic epithelial cells towards the clinical practice.

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate, for the first time, the human seroprevalence of Q fever in Lebanon, by assessing the presence of antibodies against the causative agent, Coxiella burnetii. A total number of 421 serum samples (226 females and 196 males) were collected in February 2015 from hospitals and laboratories dispersed in five Lebanese provinces: Akkar, Bekaa, Mount Lebanon, Nabatieh, and South Lebanon. Methods: Serial testing approach was used. Samples were first screened for IgG phase II antibodies against C. burnetii by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Kit. Then, both positive and inconclusive sera were reexamined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) test with the aims to confirm and specify the infection status (past or probably acute infection) by detecting IgG (I/II) and IgM (I/II) in human sera. Results: Screening of 421 samples was estimated to be 38.70% (95% CI 34-43.3) positive samples, 5.90% (95% CI 3.7-8.2) suspect samples (as doubtful results), and 55.40% (95% CI 50.7-60.1) negative samples. Furthermore, all positive and suspect samples by ELISA test were retested by immunofluorescence assay test (IFAT), and the prevalence of positive sample was 37% and the infection case was recorded: 23.75% (95% CI 19.7-27.8) samples resulted from past infection, 1.9% (95% CI 0.6-3.2) probably acute infection characterized by several dominance clinical symptoms as: fever, cough, headache, difficulty breathing, and atypical pneumonia, and 0.23% (95% CI 0-0.7) inconclusive sample accompanied by different symptoms as bone metastasis and lung cancer. Conclusion: The study records the exposition of 37% of 421 patients to C. burnetii distributed in five Lebanese provinces with the highest seroprevalence in Bekaa and Akkar provinces and the lowest reported in Mount Lebanon. This difference may be due to the presence of high density of livestock production and of major agricultural areas in these two provinces. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.},

abstract={Lipophilic marine biotoxins include okadaic acid, pectenotoxin, yessotoxin and azaspiracid groups. The consumption of contaminated molluscs can lead to acute food poisoning syndromes depending on the exposure level. Regulatory limits have been set by Regulation (European Community, 2004a) No 853/2004 and LC-MS/MS is used as the official analytical method according to Regulation (European Community, 2011) No 15/2011. In this study specimens of mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were collected along the coasts of the central Adriatic Sea during the years 2015-2017 and analyzed by the European harmonized Standard Operating Procedure. The method was validated for linearity, specificity, repeatability and reproducibility and it revealed able to be used for the detection of the lipophilic marine biotoxins. Levels of okadaic acid, pectenotoxin, yessotoxin and its analogs were detected at different concentrations in 148 (37%) out of a total of 400 samples, always below the maximum limits, except for 11 (4.3%) of them that were non-compliant because they exceeded the regulatory limit. Moreover, some samples were exposed to a multi-toxin mixture with regards to okadaic acid, yessotoxin and 1-Homo yessotoxin. Following these results, the aquaculture farms from which the non-compliant samples derived were closed until the analytical data of two consecutive samplings returned favorable. Besides the potential risk of consumption of mussels contaminated by lipophilic marine biotoxins, these marine organisms can be considered as bio-indicators of the contamination status of the marine ecosystem. © 2018 Schirone, Berti, Visciano, Chiumiento, Migliorati, Tofalo, Suzzi, Di Giacinto and Ferri.},

abstract={Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen with a worldwide distribution, and infects several mammalian species, including pigs and wild boars, which are recognized as its natural reservoirs. The virus causes a usually self-limiting liver disease with a mortality rate generally below 1%, although mortality rates of 15%–25% have been recorded in pregnant woman. Chronic infections can also occur. The prevalence of HEV has been extensively studied in wild boars and pigs in northern Italy, where intensive pig herds are predominantly located. In contrast, few data have been collected in south-central Italy, where small pig herds are surrounded by large regional parks populated with heterogeneous wild fauna. In this study, 291 liver samples from wild boars caught in south-central Italy were analysed with the molecular detection of viral RNA. Our results confirm the circulation of HEV in these animals, with a mean prevalence of 13.7% (40 of 291). A nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the HEV strains were highly conserved within the same geographic areas. The wild boar HEV strains belonged to the HEV-3c subtype, which is frequently described in wild boars, and to an uncommon undefined subtype (HEV-3j-like).The viral prevalence detected is concerning because it could represent a potential risk to hunters, meat workers and consumers of wild boar liver and derivative products. The hypothesized inter-species transmission of HEV to pigs and the possibility that the virus maintains its virulence in the environment and the meat chain also present potential risks to human health, and warrant further investigations in the near future. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={We conducted a cross-sectional study during 2013 to quantify the serological prevalence of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) infection and to investigate host factors associated with PPR infection in small ruminants in Libya. A two-stage sampling design was carried out. A total number of 148 flocks owning at least 100 heads each were randomly selected. Sixteen to forty-eight samples were collected from each selected flock. A total number of 3,508 serum samples from unvaccinated animals were collected and analysed at IZSLER Brescia, Italy, by using competitive ELISA, IDvet innovative diagnostics (IDvet 310, France). The overall serological prevalence among SR was 33% (95% CI: 31.4–34.5). Significant differences between the prevalence in the geographical branches were observed. The lowest prevalence level was observed in Zawiyah branch (16.1%), whereas the highest value was obtained for the Sabha branch (56.8%). Considering the age, a serological prevalence of 24.7%, 31.5% and 42.1% was observed in SR <1 year, between 1 and 2 years and more than 2 years, respectively. Statistically significant differences (p <.001) in the sero-prevalence levels were also observed between the age groups. Our findings suggest that the southern part of Libya could be more exposed to the infections coming from the neighbouring countries and this should be better investigated to correctly identify wherever specific entry points can be considered at higher risk than others. The results also confirmed the endemic status of PPR in Libya, with a constant exposure to the infection of the animals during their life. In the framework of the global strategy for control and eradication of PPR, our results, even if obtained by a preliminary study, can contribute to the assessment of the epidemiological situation of PPR in Libya as required by the Stage 1 of the plan. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a severe disease caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm). Knowledge on CBPP pathogenesis is fragmented and hampered by the limited availability of laboratory animal and in vitro models of investigation. The purpose of the present study is to assess respiratory explants as useful tools to study the early stages of CBPP. Explants were obtained from trachea, bronchi and lungs of slaughtered cattle, tested negative for Mycoplasma spp. and for the major bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens. The interaction of Mmm with explant cells was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC), double-labelling indirect immunofluorescence (DLIIF) and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). Mmm capability to survive and proliferate within the explants was evaluated by standard microbiological procedures. Finally, the putative cellular internalization of Mmm was further investigated by the gentamicin invasion assay. IHC and DLIIF indicated that Mmm can colonize explants, showing a marked tropism for lower airways. Specifically, Mmm was detected on/inside the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells, the alveolar macrophages and the endothelial cells. The interaction between Mmm and explant cells was abolished by the pre-incubation of the pathogen with bovine anti-Mmm immune sera. Mmm was able to survive and proliferate in all tracheal, bronchial and lung explants, during the entire time course of the experiments. LSCM and gentamicin invasion assay both confirmed that Mmm can enter non-phagocytic host cells. Taken together, our data supports bovine respiratory explants as a promising tool to investigate CBPP, alternative to cattle experimental infection. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In 2017 the Abruzzo region, located in central Italy, was struck by a sequence of four moderately powerful seismic events (5.0 magnitude on Richter scale), in addition to heavy snowfall that caused a state of emergency affecting the resident population and farm animals. A total of 282 stables were reported to have collapsed or been damaged and several animals (224 cows, 4025 ewes, 40,725 chickens, 22 horses and 3092 pigs) were killed. The Istituto Zooprofilattico of Abruzzo and Molise “G. Caporale” (IZSAM)—National Reference Center for Veterinary Urban Hygiene and Non-Epidemic Emergencies (IUVENE), played a crucial role in planning, coordinating and controlling veterinary activities during these catastrophic events. Operational and information tools were used to manage the needs of the communities involved, as well as to prioritize the veterinary interventions, record information, provide real-time data access, and produce reporting maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) layers. These events have highlighted how the integration of veterinary services into disaster management efforts can play an important role in protecting the health and welfare of animals, whilst also restoring economic activity and community life. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The application of quantitative PCR (qPCR) as a routine method to detect and enumerate Paenibacillus larvae in honey and hive debris could greatly speed up the estimation of prevalence and outbreak risk of the American foulbrood (AFB) disease of Apis mellifera. However, none of the qPCR tests described so far has been officially proposed as a standard procedure for P. larvae detection and enumeration for surveillance purposes. Therefore, in this study, inclusivity, exclusivity and sensitivity of detection of P. larvae spores directly in samples of honey and hive debris were re-evaluated for the previously published qPCR methods. To this aim, recently acquired P. larvae sequence data were considered to assess inclusivity in silico and more appropriate non-target species were used to verify exclusivity experimentally. This led to the modification of a previously described method by shortening the forward primer, designing a new reverse primer and using more stringent amplification conditions. The new test allowed the detection of P. larvae spores in honey and hive debris down to 1 CFU/g. The qPCR test optimized in this study proved suitable for quantification and also for identification of field P. larvae strains and real contaminated samples. Therefore, it is proposed for reliable detection and quantification of P. larvae in honey and hive debris, thus circumventing the disadvantages of late AFB diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and possible underestimation of spore numbers that is the main drawback of culture-dependent procedures. © 2018 by the authors.

abstract={The role of the veterinarian as a public health officer is intrinsic to the history and the culture of veterinary organization in Italy. The Veterinary service being part of the Health administration since the birth of the Italian State in the XIX Century. In the second half of the last century the birth of the Italian National Health Service confirmed that the function of the Italian veterinary service was to analyze and reduce the risks for the human population connected to the relationship man-animal-environment, animal health, food safety and security. The Italian Veterinary Medicine School curricula, reflected this “model” of veterinarian as well. In the majority of countries in the world, Veterinary Services are organized within the Agriculture Administration with the main function to assure animal health and wellbeing. After the so-called “Mad-cow crisis” the awareness of the direct and essential role of veterinary services in the prevention of human illness has been officially recognized and in the third millennium the old concept of “one health” and “human-animal interface” has gained popularity worldwide. The concept of Veterinary Public Health, has evolved at International level and has incorporated the more than a century old vision of the Italian Veterinary medicine and it is defined as “the sum of the contributions to the physical, mental and social development of people through the knowledge and application of veterinary science” (WHO, Future trends in veterinary public health. Gruppo di lavoro OMS: TE, Italy, 1999, Available from: http://www.who.int/zoonoses/vph/en/. Last visited 16 Feb 2016, 1999). On the subject of Cooperation, Sustainability and Public Health, the EXPO 2015 event and the activities of international organizations WHO, FAO and World Organization for Animal Health are refocusing at present their worldwide mandate to protect human health and the economy of both the poorest Countries and the developed countries, according to the “new” concept of Veterinary Public Health.

abstract={Brucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella, which is endemic in sub-Saharan African countries, including Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe has a widespread dairy industry with peri-urban dairy establishments built in order to improve milk availability to rural communities. This study has been the first attempt to estimate the prevalence of brucellosis in Zimbabwe as a whole, using samples submitted to the Central veterinary laboratory between 2010 and 2014. A total of 156 farms were tested with Rose Bengal Test (RBT), Complement Fixation Test (CFT) and Milk Ring Test (MRT). Parallel testing was used to determine whether or not a farm was to be considered positive: 30.1% (95% C.I.: 23.5% - 37.8%) of the farms tested were found positive (47/156). Harare district had the highest number of sample submissions with 6 out of 17 farms testing positive (P = 37.5%; 95% C.I.: 18.4% - 61.7%). Awareness of milk-borne zoonoses is reportedly generally low in farmers (41.5%). This is even more the case in small-holder farmers who have higher likelihoods of selling or ingesting raw milk compared with dairy farmers. The results show the need to carry out surveillance of brucellosis in cattle in Zimbabwe to understand the spatial distribution of the disease in the country. This is particularly relevant given the zoonotic and economic implications of this disease. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Sheep are not only a major livestock species globally, they are also an important large animal model for biomedical research and have contributed to our understanding of the ontogeny and architecture of the mammalian immune system. In this study, we applied immunohistochemistry and multicolor immunofluorescence in fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes to phenotype the key populations of antigen presenting cells, lymphocytes, and stromal cells that orchestrate the host adaptive immune response. We used an extensive panel of antibodies directed against markers associated with dendritic cells (MHC class II, CD83, and CD208), macrophages (CD11b, CD163, and CD169), stromal cells (CNA.42, S100, and CD83), and lymphocytes (CD3, Pax5, CD4, CD8). Using different methods of tissue fixation and antigen retrieval, we provide a detailed immunophenotyping of sheep lymph nodes including the identification of potential subpopulations of antigen presenting cells and stromal cells. By characterizing cells expressing combinations of these markers in the context of their morphology and location within the lymph node architecture, we provide valuable new tools to investigate the structure, activation, and regulation of the sheep immune system in health and disease.},

abstract={Anthrax caused by Bacillus anthracis is an old and neglected zoonosis that continues to raise concerns in Southern Africa. In this study, twenty (20) slides with suspected isolates of B. anthracis from anthrax cases between 1990 and 2014 and two (2) from that of a vaccine strain were analysed using MLVA with 15 VNTRs and CanSNPs test. The results from the CanSNPs indicate that all anthrax outbreaks in Zambia between 1990 and 2014 were caused by the lineage A. Br.005/006 of the clade A. This indicates a common ancestral origin of the B. anthracis circulating in the country. This data has described several environmental, wildlife, livestock and human cases that occurred in a 24 year period, from the major areas where anthrax is endemic. The molecular characterization of isolates from anthrax outbreaks in Zambia has revealed a genetic structure in agreement with previous studies from neighbouring countries. Further studies are needed to elucidate how to better manage anthrax outbreaks and define the risk maps of Zambia. © 2018 Fasanella et al.},

abstract={The field of regenerative medicine is moving toward clinical practice in veterinary science. In this context, placenta-derived stem cells isolated from domestic animals have covered a dual role, acting both as therapies for patients and as a valuable cell source for translational models. The biological properties of placenta-derived cells, comparable among mammals, make them attractive candidates for therapeutic approaches. In particular, stemness features, low immunogenicity, immunomodulatory activity, multilineage plasticity, and their successful capacity for long-term engraftment in different host tissues after autotransplantation, allo-transplantation, or xenotransplantation have been demonstrated. Their beneficial regenerative effects in domestic animals have been proven using preclinical studies as well as clinical trials starting to define the mechanisms involved. This is, in particular, for amniotic-derived cells that have been thoroughly studied to date. The regenerative role arises from a mutual tissue-specific cell differentiation and from the paracrine secretion of bioactive molecules that ultimately drive crucial repair processes in host tissues (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, angiogenic, and neurogenic factors). The knowledge acquired so far on the mechanisms of placenta-derived stem cells in animal models represent the proof of concept of their successful use in some therapeutic treatments such as for musculoskeletal disorders. In the next future, legislation in veterinary regenerative medicine will be a key element in order to certify those placenta-derived cell-based protocols that have already demonstrated their safety and efficacy using rigorous approaches and to improve the degree of standardization of cell-based treatments among veterinary clinicians. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) was detected for the first time in Tunisia and in other Northern African countries in 2006. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether EHDV circulated in Tunisian livestock before and after the officially-reported outbreak of 2006. Thus, serum samples from cattle and dromedaries collected in different time periods (before and after 2006) and from different regions of Tunisia were screened for the presence of EHDV antibodies. Serological investigations conducted on cattle and dromedary sera collected in 2000 and 2001 demonstrated no virus circulation on these dates. However, viral circulation was evidenced in 2012 and 2013, although no EHDV cases were officially reported in these years. Serum-neutralization assessed on few ELISA positive samples, confirmed the presence of antibodies against EHDV serotype 6, which was the serotype involved in the EHDV outbreak in the Maghreb region in 2006. © 2018, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Several epidemics caused by different bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes occurred in European ruminants since the early 2000. Studies on the spatial distribution of these vector-borne infections and the main vector species highlighted contrasted eco-climatic regions characterized by different dominant vector species. However, little work was done regarding the factors associated with the velocity of these epidemics. In this study, we aimed to quantify and compare the velocity of BTV epidemic that have affected different European countries under contrasted eco-climatic conditions and to relate these estimates to spatial factors such as temperature and host density. We used the thin plate spline regression interpolation method in combination with trend surface analysis to quantify the local velocity of different epidemics that have affected France (BTV-8 2007–2008, BTV-1 2008–2009), Italy (BTV-1 2014), Andalusia in Spain (BTV-1 2007) and the Balkans (BTV-4 2014). We found significant differences in the local velocity of BTV spread according to the country and epidemics, ranging from 7.9 km/week (BTV-1 2014 Italy) to 24.4 km/week (BTV-1 2008 France). We quantify and discuss the effect of temperature and local host density on this velocity. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={The first epidemics of lumpy skin disease (LSD) reported in Europe in 2015 severely affected the cattle farming sector in several Balkan countries. After the first incursion into Greece in 2015, the disease quickly spread across the Balkan region with over 7000 outbreaks reported by the end of 2016. Thanks to a coordinated regional control and eradication policy, the spread of the disease was halted by the end of 2017. Regional large-scale vaccination campaign with effective homologous vaccines and high vaccination coverage revealed to be essential for the successful control the disease, supported by other measures such as early detection of outbreaks, total or partial stamping out and restrictions on cattle movements. The aim of this paper is to discuss the field observations, challenges and lessons learnt while dealing with the first LSD epidemics in Europe. The cross-border collaboration by the veterinary authorities of all affected countries, coordinated by the European Commission and the technical support provided by many other international organizations played a fundamental role in stopping the spread of a disease that otherwise could have expanded further to the European territory causing a large damage to the whole European cattle farming industry. The experience obtained during the control of LSD epidemics indicates that in the future LSD spread can be effectively halted, provided that appropriate surveillance plans and vigilance remains in place in the areas at risk of re-incursion, especially those bordering endemic countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The adoption of high-througput technologies demonstrated that in mature spermatozoa are present proteins that are thought to be not present or active in sperm cells, such as those involved in control of cell cycle. Here, by using an in silico approach based on the application of networks theory, we found that Cyclins/Cdk complexes could play a central role in signal transduction active during capacitation. Then, we tested this hypothesis in the vitro model. With this approach, spermatozoa were incubated under capacitating conditions in control conditions (CTRL) or in the presence of Aminopurvalanol A a potent, selective and cell permeable inhibitor of Cyclins/Cdk complexes at different concentrations (2, 10, and 20 μM). We found that this treatment caused dose-dependent inhibition of sperm fertilizing ability. We attribute this event to the loss of acrosome integrity due to the inhibition of physiological capacitation-dependent actin polymerization, rather than to a detrimental effect on membrane lipid remodeling or on other signaling pathways such as tubulin reorganization or MAPKs activation. In our opinion, these data could revamp the knowledge on biochemistry of sperm capacitation and could suggest new perspectives in studying male infertility. © 2017 Bernabò, Valbonetti, Greco, Capacchietti, Ramal Sanchez, Palestini, Botto, Mattioli and Barboni.},

In this study, mtDNA heteroplasmy at an intra-oocyte level and between the different analyzed human oocytes (n = 12) was identified by a next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol previously developed by this research group and submitted to GenBank. This method highlighted, in particular, variants in the genes involved in the respiratory chain providing a direct indication of the cell-specific damage within the mitochondrial genome as predictor of the oocyte quality. © 2017, © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={The in vitro expansion is detrimental to therapeutic applications of amniotic epithelial cells (AEC), an emerging source of fetal stem cells. This study provides molecular evidences of progesterone (P4) role in preventing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovine AEC (oAEC). oAEC amplified under standard conditions spontaneously acquired mesenchymal properties through the up-regulation of EMT-transcription factors. P4 supplementation prevented phenotype shift by inhibiting the EMT-inducing mechanism such as the autocrine production of TGF-β and the activation of intracellular-related signaling. The effect of P4 still persisted for one passage after steroid removal from culture as well as steroid supplementation promptly reversed mesenchymal phenotype in oAEC which have experienced EMT during amplification. Furthermore, P4 promoted an acute up-regulation of pluripotent genes whereas enhanced basal and LPS-induced oAEC anti-inflammatory response with an increase in anti-inflammatory and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines expression. Altogether, these results indicate that P4 supplementation is crucial to preserve epithelial phenotype and to enhance biological properties in expanded oAEC. Therefore, an innovative cultural approach is proposed in order to improve therapeutic potential of this promising source of epithelial stem cells. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={A case of Vibrio parahaemolyticus- and V. alginolyticus-associated meningo-encephalitis in a bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) found stranded along the Adriatic coast of Italy in 2016 is herein reported, along with a minireview on V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus infections in aquatic mammals. Macroscopically, two abscesses were found in the dolphin's forebrain, along with an extensive, bilateral, parasitic broncho-pneumonia. Histologically, a suppurative-to-pyogranulomatous meningo-encephalitis involved the brain but not the cerebellum. Microbiological investigations yielded isolation of V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus from the aforementioned abscesses and from the brain parenchyma, respectively, with simultaneous recovery of Shewanella algae from the heart and of Photobacterium damselae from a blowhole swab. Although V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus, which are widely distributed across marine ecosystems worldwide, likely played a role in the development of the suppurative meningo-encephalitis in this dolphin, we are not aware of previous isolations of any of these two bacteria neither from cetacean brain lesions, nor from abscesses in aquatic mammals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Several arthropod-borne diseases are now rising with increasing impact and risks for public health, due to environmental changes and resistance to pesticides currently marketed. In addition to community surveillance programs and a careful management of herds, a next-generation of effective products is urgently needed to control the spread of these diseases, with special reference to arboviral ones. Natural product research can afford alternative solutions. Recently, a re-emerging of bluetongue disease is ongoing in Italy. Bluetongue is a viral disease that affects ruminants and is spread through the bite of bloodsucking insects, especially Culicoides species. In this review, we focused on the importance of vector control programs for prevention or bluetongue outbreaks, outlining the lack of effective tools in the fight against Culicoides vectors. Then, we analyzed a field case study in Sardinia (Italy) concerning the utilization of the neem cake (Azadirachta indica), to control young instar populations of Culicoides biting midges, the vectors of bluetongue virus. Neem cake is a cheap and eco-friendly by-product obtained from the extraction of neem oil. Overall, we propose that the employ of neem extraction by-products as aqueous formulations in muddy sites close to livestock grazing areas may represent an effective tool in the fight against the spread of bluetongue virus in the Mediterranean areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Morbilliviruses, such as Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) or Phocine distemper virus (PDV), represent a growing threat for marine mammals on both hemispheres. Because free-ranging animal populations strongly rely on natural resistance mechanisms, innate immunity-related genes and virus cell entry receptor genes may represent key factors involved in susceptibility to CeMV in Cetaceans. Using the next generation sequencing technology, we have sequenced 11 candidate genes in two model species, Stenella coeruleoalba and Phocoena phocoena. Suitable single nucleotide polymorphism markers of potential functional importance, located in genes coding for basigin (BSG, CD147), the signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAMF1), the poliovirus-related receptor-4 (NECTIN4, PVRL4), toll-like receptors 3, 7, 8 (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8), natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (SLC11A1) and natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1 (NCR1), were identified in each model species, along with MHC-DQB haplotypes unique for each species. This set of molecular markers represents a potentially useful tool for studying host genetic variation and susceptibility to morbillivirus infection in Cetaceans as well as for studying functionally important genetic diversity of selected Cetacean populations. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

abstract={The concentrations of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-concentrations dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) (PCDD/Fs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were determined in fruit and vegetables collected in farms located in the well-known "Land of Fires" area of Southern Italy, in an effort to learn more about the environmental pollution of this high-risk area due to illegal waste dumping and uncontrolled burning near cultivated fields. Concentrations were in the range 0.011-2.26 ng g-1 for the six "indicator" non-dioxin-like PCBs (NDL-PCBs), and 0.0009-0.096 pg WHO toxic equivalent (TEQ) g-1 for the sum of dioxin-like PCBs (DL-PCBs) and PCDD/Fs. Lacking maximum limits for these contaminants in fruit and vegetables, the concentration values found were compared with the action levels set out in the EU Recommendations. These levels were never exceeded in the examined samples. In the present study, the highest mean value for PCDD/Fs + DL-PCB corresponded to apricots, olives, and nuts, while the lowest values were observed in endive and green beans. The results showed also that NDL-PCB levels in apricots were much higher than in any other food, suggesting that they can accumulate PCBs: this fruit might be proposed as a "sentinel" of the presence of these contaminants in the environment. © 2017 by the authors.},

B. suis biovar 2 is the most common isolate in Europe, with high prevalence reported in wild boars in which it is generally isolated in the absence of gross lesions. In the last five years, we tested for Brucella spp. 389 lymph nodes of wild boars collected during hunting seasons or during necropsy procedures. In this paper, we describe the first case of isolation of B. suis biovar 2 from a wild boar aborted foetus, and we analyse the genomic relationships with B.suis biovar 2 strains isolated in the past five years in Abruzzi Region, Central Italy. The genetic fingerprint revealed that the isolates under study belong to the MLST ST16 and to the MLVA11 Gt 57, similar to the Central-Eastern European strains. Massive restocking (for hunting purpose) of wild boars from Eastern Europe have been done since 1950 in Italy contributing to the increasing of population size and distribution, as well as to the interbreeding between these foreign breeds and the local population. The contamination of pastures with infected material such as aborted wild boars foetuses can increase the risk of transmission of Brucella among wild and domestic animals. The contact of B. suis with domestic ruminants may also cause serological reactions to brucellosis serological testing, and even unapparent infection, thus hampering the efforts made in the brucellosis eradication campaign. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Hantaviruses are a group of zoonotic viruses carried by rodents. Puumala virus (PUUV) and Dobrava virus (DOBV) are the causative agents of human hantavirus infections in Europe. Knowledge about hantavirus circulation in Italy is very scarce. West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are emerging neuropathogenic flaviviruses, both endemic in most part of the Italian territories. To monitor the circulation of PUUV, DOBV, WNV, and USUV in natural environment in central Italy, we carried out serological surveillance in wild rodents. During this study, 90 animals were captured in forested areas of Abruzzo and Marche regions and tested with serological assays for the specific pathogens. Serological test provided no evidence of PUUV and DOBV circulation in the studied area. However, four rodents (Apodemus flavicollis) were found to be positive by WNV ELISA test. Two of them were confirmed as WNV by virus neutralization test. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={West Nile virus-associated disease is one of the most widespread vector-borne diseases in the world. In Morocco, the first cases were reported in horses in 1996 and the disease re-emerged in 2003 and in 2010. The objective of this work was to study the epidemiological situation of WNV-associated infection in Morocco, by quantifying the seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and IgG antibodies in horses in different bioclimatic regionszones of Morocco in 2011. During the months of May, June and July 2011, 840 serum samples were collected from horses in four regions characterized by different environmental and climatic features such as altitude, temperature and precipitation. These environmental-climatic regions are: the Atlantic plateaus of the Gharb and pre-Rif region, the North Atlasic plains and plateaus region, the Atlas Mountains and pre-Atlas region and the plains and plateaus of the Oriental region. All samples were tested for the anti-WNV IgG antibodies by ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by virus neutralization (VN). An anti-WNV antibody prevalence map was developed. A total of 261 samples (31%) were found positive by both techniques. The prevalence of the infection was higher in the Atlantic plateaus of the Gharb and pre-Rif region, in the northern part of the country. Available data concerning the previous WNV-associated disease outbreaks in Morocco and the preliminary results of this serological survey suggest that the Moroccan northwest is the region at highest risk for WNV circulation. In this region, the climate is more humid with higher rainfall than other regions and milder winter temperatures exist. In the same area, the presence of migratory bird settlements may affect the risk of virus introduction and amplification. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={In this preliminary study, a digestive method used in forensic context to extract diatoms has been applied in organs taken from ten wildlife animals belonging three species of mammals (a deer, a roe and five otters) and one species of birds (two magpies). Only four carcasses were recovered from aquatic environments (bath trough for animals, bathtub irrigation, river) and only in three cases out of ten that the cause of death was ruled out as drowning. In seven cases, the death was due to other causes: gunshot injuries for one otter, blunt trauma for a magpie, and traumatic injuries followed by motor vehicle collision in other four otters and a roe. Post-mortem examination was performed in all carcasses. The diatom test protocol was performed according to the Italian guidelines for analysis of benthic diatoms for ecological status assessment of inland waters. Five grams of lung, liver, and kidney was taken from all the animal carcasses. In some cases, additional tissue samples were also available among which brain, heart, spleen, and bone marrow. In all four cases found in water, the drowning medium was also available. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) digestion was performed, and identification of 21 genera of diatoms was obtained. The method proved to be suitable for the identification of diatoms in the organs of the animals drowned supporting the final diagnosis of drowning. Only in otters, all died for causes other than drowning, diatoms did not prove to be suitable for the diagnosis of drowning since their presence in the internal organs was mainly related to their main diet based on fishmeal. The authors believe that this first trial is very promising, and the results suggest that diatom test can be easily applied in forensic veterinary context. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a vector-borne infectious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants. EHD could spread from infected northern African countries in free territories like the EU; therefore, the availability of diagnostic assays would represent key components for adequate surveillance and control programs. In this study, the gene encoding the VP7 protein of EHD virus (EHDV) was expressed into a baculovirus-infected insect cell system. With this unpurified protein we developed a home-made competitive ELISA (cELISA) and a total number of 275 serum samples, originating from domestic and wild ruminants, were tested. 74/275 were previously shown to be positive for EHDV antibodies by a commercially available ELISA kit. A “very good” agreement was demonstrated when compared to a commercial ELISA kit (Cohen's kappa value = 0.832). Samples which caused disagreement between the two assays originated from wildlife which highlights the need for further validation by using serum samples from wild animals. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Yersinia enterocolitica causes foodborne disease in humans and infections are usually acquired from contaminated raw or undercooked pork. Pigs are considered the primary reservoir of human pathogenic bio-serotypes. A total of 376 tonsil tissue samples collected after evisceration and cutting from pig carcasses were tested for Yersinia enterocolitica. Animals came from an abattoir located in the Abruzzo region, Italy. Yersinia enterocolitica was isolated from 35 out of 376 (9.31%) samples. A total of 47 strains were isolated, the prevalent bio-serotype was 4/O:3 (95.74%), followed by bio-serotype 4/O:9 (2.13%), and 3/O:9 (2.13%). When characterized by DNA microarray, all strains clustered into 2 main groups. The bigger group was characterised by the presence of plasmid genes of the secretion apparatus as well as by the genes for the flagellum transport machinery, while the smaller group was characterised only by genes for the flagellum transport machinery. The high frequency of the pathogenic biotype 4/O:3 able to infect humans and considered an emerging zoonotic pathogen confirms the role of pigs as natural reservoir. Since there is no official data on Yersinia enterocolitica, it is difficult to assess the implications of this food pathogen for public health. A monitoring program should be implemented for contamination in food in order to assess the risk for the consumer linked to raw or undercooked pork products. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Ten normal prostates, 22 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 29 prostate cancer (PC) were morphometrically analyzed with regard to mean nuclear area (MNA), mean nuclear perimeter (MNP), mean nuclear diameter (MND), coefficient of variation of the nuclear area (NACV), mean nuclear diameter maximum (MDx), mean nuclear diameter minimum (MDm), mean nuclear form ellipse (MNFe) and form factor (FF). The relationship between nuclear morphometric parameters and histological type, Gleason score, methods of sample collection, presence of metastases and survival time of canine PC were also investigated. Overall, nuclei from neoplastic cells were larger, with greater variation in nuclear size and shape compared to normal and hyperplastic cells. Significant differences were found between more (small acinar/ductal) and less (cribriform, solid) differentiated PCs with regard to FF (p < 0.05). MNA, MNP, MND, MDx, and MDm were significantly correlated with the Gleason score of PC (p < 0.05). MNA, MNP, MDx and MNFe may also have important prognostic implications in canine prostatic cancer since negatively correlated with the survival time. Biopsy specimens contained nuclei that were smaller and more irregular in comparison to those in prostatectomy and necropsy specimens and therefore factors associated with tissue sampling and processing may influence the overall morphometric evaluation. The results indicate that nuclear morphometric analysis in combination with Gleason score can help in canine prostate cancer grading, thus contributing to the establishment of a more precise prognosis and patient's management. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={An oligonucleotide DNA microarray targeting 348 virulence factors and genetic markers was used in the pathotyping, serotyping and phylogrouping of 51 Escherichia coli strains isolated from faecal samples. The samples were collected from diarrhoeic 1 to 30 days old calves located at 14 farms in the Teheran province, Iran. Positive microarray signals for genes encoding the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE), the Type III Secretion System (TTSS), and the absence of EPEC adherence factor (EAF) permitted the pathotyping of 25 strains as atypical Enteropathogenic (aEPEC) or Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). The lack of LEE and TTSS-associated genes distinguished the remaining 26 strains, which were classified as Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Atypical EPEC belonged to phylogroup B1 and possessed a LEE profile tir-1, eae(beta), espA-1, espB-3. The EHEC strains primarily belonged to the B1 phylogroup type-O26 and possessed either a LEE profile tir-1, eae(beta), espA-1, espB-3, or a B1 type-O111, LEE tir-3, eae(gamma), espA-1, espB-2. ExPEC-typed strains generally harboured genes localised to the constant region of Colicin V plasmid (pColV), including increased serum survival factor (iss), complement resistance protein (traT), aerobactin operon (iucD), and the siderophore receptor (iroN). The microarray platform used in this study is well suited to accurately and rapidly type attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC-types), thus providing a database for the meta-analysis of ExPEC-typed strains. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise.

abstract={Dogs housed in shelters may experience poor welfare. To ensure these dogs a good quality of life, welfare assessment tools should be sensitive not only to the animals’ physical health but also to their mental state, including the assessment of positive and negative emotions. In this study, we focused on the assessment of shelter dogs’ emotional expression using a Qualitative Behavioural Assessment (QBA) approach. Previous work successfully applied QBA to assess the emotional state of working and rescue dogs, and the observations were carried out on individual dogs in standardised settings with little or no stimulation. Results from such experiments might not be fully representative of the expressive demeanour that a dog could show in shelter conditions, where animals are exposed to a number of social and environmental stimuli. Thus, our aim was to apply QBA to a wider variety of shelter environments and social contexts than has been done so far, giving the animals the opportunity to express a wider repertoire of emotions and allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of dogs’ affective state. A set of descriptive terms was generated using Free-Choice-Profiling methodology by a group of 13 observers. QBA was made by scoring 16 video clips of shelter dogs in very different contexts (e.g. single/pair/group housing, presence/absence of human activity). Generalised Procrustes Analysis showed a high consensus between observers’ scoring patterns (75.7%; p < 0.001), and generated three main consensus dimensions explaining overall 66.6% of the variation between clips. The terms generated by the observers describing these consensus dimensions were semantically consistent, and characterised dogs as ranging: 1) from “playful/sociable/curious” to “bored/uncomfortable/apathetic” 2) from “relaxed/tranquil” to “nervous/alert/fearful” and 3) from “stressed/anxious” to “wary/timorous/hesitant”. Overall, these broad dimensions are similar to those described in previous QBA studies on dogs. However, we detected differences in the type or frequency of the terms used, especially concerning three semantic spheres (i.e. “sociability” “fearfulness” and “boredom”). It appears that, compared to what has been reported previously, by presenting more complex contexts and thus giving the animals the opportunity to express different behaviours, we generated a richer list of terms representing a wider repertoire of emotions. Our results support the notion that QBA can be immediately sensitive to an animal's circumstances, integrating the ways in which animals experience the conditions in which they live into meaningful emotional indicators. This also highlights the importance of developing QBA tools that are species- and context-specific, especially for applied purposes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) are double-stranded RNA orbiviruses of the Reoviridae family. Bluetongue virus and EHDV infect domestic and wild ruminants and they are transmitted by biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Since 1999, BTV outbreaks have occurred in Tunisia and 4 serotypes, BTV2, BTV1, BTV4 and BTV3, were involved in 2000, 2006, 2009, and 2016, respectively. Epizootic haemorrhagic disease was detected for the first time in Tunisia and in other Northern African countries in 2006. These incursions have caused considerable economic losses. Our study had the goal to describe diversity, distribution, and seasonal dynamics of Culicoides. Fourteen sampling sites were chosen throughout the country and 2-night trapping of midges was performed monthly from June 2006 to July 2008. A total of 11,582 Culicoides specimens were collected from 336 light traps, comprising 25 species, of which 7 were identified for the first time in Tunisia, increasing to 35 the total number of Culicoides species now reported in this country. Twenty-three pools of parous females belonging to the Culicoides imicola and Culicoides kingi were tested for detection of BTV and EHDV by molecular assays. Both BTV1 and BTV4 were detected in C. imicola. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico dell'Abruzzo e del Molise. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mycoplasma infections are commonly associated with respiratory diseases in farm animals. However, few data are currently available about the presence and the etiology of mycoplasma pneumonia in small ruminants in central Italy, a region particularly devoted to pastoralism. The present study aims to investigate retrospectively the causative agents of pneumonia in sheep and goats, a special emphasis being placed upon mycoplasmas. In total, respiratory pathogens were identified in 129 of 380 carcasses (32.36%). Mycoplasmas were detected in a high percentage of cases, alone (59 animals) or in combination with other pathogens (26 animals), Mycoplasma arginini being the most frequent species. No evidence of mycoplasma infection was demonstrated in 44 carcasses; in such animals, Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida were most commonly isolated. Overall, our results suggest that mycoplasma infections can contribute to a relevant portion of respiratory diseases in small ruminants and support the role of Mycoplasma arginini as a frequent cause of pneumonia in sheep. We consider that such data are of value to efficiently manage the health status of animal populations. © 2017},

This method involved a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The method validation was performed by analyzing samples spiked at four levels, and the recoveries ranged from 83.6 to 102.9%, whereas the maximum values of repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility were 14.3 and 15.7% following the performance criteria set by the European legislation. The method was then applied for the analysis of 21 cereal-derived products purchased on the Italian market, which were correctly packaged and labeled as intended for human consumption. The co-occurrence of more than one mycotoxin in the analyzed samples could represent a risk for consumers, and the described method could be a valid alternative for their simultaneous detection in the framework of official control.

abstract={An immunohistochemical (IHC) technique was optimised using a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to detect Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm), the agent of Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), in sections of lung tissue. A panel of MAbs was produced and screened for Mmm specificity and for cross-reactivity against other mycoplasmas belonging and not belonging to the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster, using in parallel indirect ELISA (i-ELISA) and Immunoblotting (IB). Based on i-ELISA and IB characterization data, 1 MAb (clone 3G10E7) was selected and its highest affinity vs Mmm was confirmed by the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) technology. Afterwards, IHC analyses were conducted to compare MAb 3G10E7 vs rabbit Mmm specific hyperimmune serum using lung tissue sections of CBPP infected and CBPP negative animals. Results suggest that screening of MAbs using in parallel ELISA, IB, and QCM technology enables to select high affinity target specific MAbs. Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that MAb 3G10E7 improved IHC performances, showing reduced background staining and no cross-reactivity against Mycoplasma bovis, which is responsible of pneumonia in cattle. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={In recent years, novel Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes have been isolated and/or sequenced by researchers within the field. During Bluetongue surveillance activities, we identified a putative novel BTV serotype in healthy goats from Sardinia, Italy. RNAs purified from blood and serum samples were positive for BTV by a generic real time RT-PCR and c-ELISA, respectively, whereas genotyping and serotyping were unsuccessful. By NGS, the whole genome sequence was obtained from two blood samples (BTV-X ITL2015 strains 34200 and 33531). Overall, Seg 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 shows the highest identity (75.3–75.5% nt/77.4–78.1% aa) with recently isolated BTV-27s from Corsica and with the last discovered BTV XJ1407 from China (75.9% nt /78.2% aa), whereas it is less related with BTV-25 from Switzerland (73.0% nt/75.0% aa) and BTV-26 from Kuwait (62.0% nt/60.5% aa). A specific RT-qPCR targeting Seg 2 of BTV-X ITL2015 was assessed in this study. Considering the Seg 2/VP2 identity of BTV-X ITL2015 with BTV-25, 26, 27s and BTV XJ1407 and that serum of BTV-X ITL2015 infected goats failed to neutralize all tested extant serotypes, we propose the existence of a novel BTV serotype circulating in goats in Sardinia. Isolation was so far unsuccessful thus hampering proper antigenic characterization. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod borne virus of public health importance. The virus is a member of the genus Flavivirus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex under the Flaviviridae family. The WNV is continuously spreading across Tunisia especially in the coastal and Southern area of the country. The first human West Nile disease (WND) epidemic in Tunisia occurred in 1997, since then, the quantity and the extension of spillover effects increased constantly. However, the existing knowledge of factors triggering such events continues to be rather poor. The last epidemic WNV human meningitis and meningoencephalitis recorded in 2012, with 86 cases and 6 deaths, confirmed the failure of the current system in predicting new cases. This review, based on analysis of scientific papers published between 1970 and 2015, summarises the state of knowledge on WNV in Tunisia and highlights the existing knowledge and research gaps that need to be addressed. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={This work investigated bacteriophage induced starter failures in artisanal buffalo Mozzarella production plants in Southern Italy. Two hundred and ten samples of whey starter cultures were screened for bacteriophage infection. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed phage infection in 28.56% of samples, all showing acidification problems during cheese making. Based on DNA sequences, bacteriophages for Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis), Lactobacillus delbruekii (L. delbruekii) and Streptococcus thermophilus (S. thermophilus) were detected. Two phages active against L. lactis, φApr-1 and φApr-2, were isolated and characterised. The genomes, approximately 31.4 kb and 31 kb for φApr-1 and φApr-2 respectively, consisted of double-stranded linear DNA with pac-type system. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS--PAGE) showed one major structural protein of approximately 32.5 kDa and several minor proteins. This is the first report of phage isolation in buffalo milk and of the use of multiplex PCR to screen and study the diversity of phages against Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) strains in artisanal Water Buffalo Mozzarella starters. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={C. jejuni is considered a food safety concern to both public health authorities and consumers since it is the leading bacterial cause of food-borne gastroenteritis in humans. A high incidence of C. jejuni in broiler flocks is often correlated to pathogen recovery in retail poultry meat, which is the main source of human infection. In this work broiler chickens were fed with a synbiotic product mixed with conventional feed using two different administration strategies. The synbiotic was formulated with the microencapsulated probiotic Bifidobacterium longum PCB133 and a xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS). 1-day old chicks were infected with C. jejuni strain M1 (105 cells) and the synbiotic mixture was then administered starting from the first and the 14th day of chicken life (for animal groups GrpC and GrpB respectively). The goal of this study was to monitor C. jejuni load at caecum level at different sampling time by real-time PCR, identifying the best administration strategy. The microbiological analysis of the caecal content also considered the quantification of Campylobacter spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and B. longum. The supplemented synbiotic was more successful in reducing C. jejuni and Campylobacter spp. when administered lifelong, compared to the shorter supplementation (GrpB). Bifidobacterium spp. quantification did not show significant differences among treatments and B. longum PCB133 was detected in both supplemented groups evidencing the successful colonization of the strain. Moreover, the samples of the control group (GrpA) and GrpC were analysed with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) to compare the caecal microbial community profiles at the beginning and at the end of the trial. Pattern analysis evidenced the strong influence of the early synbiotic supplementation, although a physiological change in the microbial community, occurring during growth, could be observed. Experimental results demonstrate that the synbiotic approach at farm level can be an effective strategy, combined with biosecurity measures, to improve the safety of poultry meat. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is an important zoonosis that constitutes a serious hazard to public health. Prevention of human brucellosis depends on the control of the disease in animals. Livestock movement data represent a valuable source of information to understand the pattern of contacts between holdings, which may determine the inter-herds and intra-herd spread of the disease. The manuscript addresses the use of computational epidemic models rooted in the knowledge of cattle trade network to assess the probabilities of brucellosis spread and to design control strategies. Three different spread network-based models were proposed: the DFC (Disease Flow Centrality) model based only on temporal cattle network structure and unrelated to the epidemiological disease parameters; a deterministic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model; a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model in which epidemiological and demographic withinfarm aspects were also modelled. Containment strategies based on farms centrality in the cattle network were tested and discussed. All three models started from the identification of the entire sub-network originated from an infected farm, up to the fifth order of contacts. Their performances were based on data collected in Sicily in the framework of the national eradication plan of brucellosis in 2009. Results show that the proposed methods improves the efficacy and efficiency of the tracing activities in comparison to the procedure currently adopted by the veterinary services in the brucellosis control, in Italy. An overall assessment shows that the SIR model is the most suitable for the practical needs of the veterinary services, being the one with the highest sensitivity and the shortest computation time. © 2017 Savini et al.

An efficient and rapid cleanup based on microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) has been developed in order to have a good enrichment factor together with a low matrix effect. The target analytes were 25 pesticides widely used in wheat, with different physico-chemical characteristics and different mechanism of action: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as organophosphorus, carbamates, neonicotinoids, and inhibitors of ergosterol such as imidazoles and triazoles. MEPS was shown to be successful with reduction of the amount of solvent required and possibility of automation of the cleanup procedure. The whole method was then validated according to the SANCO/12571/2013 guidelines, proving its suitability as confirmation method for the selected analytes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Since 1998, southern Europe has experienced multiple incursions of different serotypes and topotypes of Bluetongue virus, a vector-borne transmitted virus, the causative agent of Bluetongue (BT), a major disease of ruminants. Some of these incursions originated from northern Africa, likely because of wind-blown dissemination of infected midges. In this report, we describe the detection and whole genome characterization of a novel BTV-3 strain identified in a symptomatic sheep in Tunisia. Sequences were immediately deposited with the GenBank Database under Accession Nos KY432369-KY432378. Alert and preparedness are requested to face the next vector seasons in northern Africa and the potential incursion of this novel strain in southern Europe. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Background: Clostridium perfringens is an important animal and human pathogen that can produce more than 16 different major and minor toxins. The beta-2 minor toxin (CPB2), comprising atypical and consensus variants, appears to be involved in both human and animal enterotoxaemia syndrome. The exact role of CPB2 in pathogenesis is poorly investigated, and its mechanism of action at the molecular level is still unknown because of the lack of specific reagents such as monoclonal antibodies against the CPB2 protein and/or the availability of a highly purified antigen. Previous studies have reported that purified wild-type or recombinant CPB2 toxin, expressed in a heterologous system, presented cytotoxic effects on human intestinal cell lines. Undoubtedly, for this reason, to date, these purified proteins have not yet been used for the production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Recently, monoclonal antibodies against CPB2 were generated using peptides designed on predicted antigenic epitopes of this toxin. Results: In this paper we report, for the first time, the expression in a baculovirus system of a deleted recombinant C-terminal 6xHis-tagged atypical CPB2 toxin (rCPB2Δ1-25-His6) lacking the 25 amino acids (aa) of the N-terminal putative signal sequence. A high level of purified recombinant rCPB2Δ1-25-His6 was obtained after purification by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The purified product showed no in vitro and in vivo toxicity. Polyclonal antibodies and twenty hybridoma-secreting Mabs were generated using purified rCPB2Δ1-25-His6. Finally, the reactivity and specificity of the new antibodies were tested against both recombinant and wild-type CPB2 toxins. Conclusions: The high-throughput of purified atoxic recombinant CPB2 produced in insect cells, allowed to obtain monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. The availability of these molecules could contribute to develop immunoenzymatic methods and/or to perform studies about the biological activity of CPB2 toxin. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={This article uses the experience of five European countries to review the integrated approaches (human, animal and vector) for surveillance and monitoring of West Nile virus (WNV) at national and European levels. The epidemiological situation of West Nile fever in Europe is heterogeneous. No model of surveillance and monitoring fits all, hence this article merely encourages countries to implement the integrated approach that meets their needs. Integration of surveillance and monitoring activities conducted by the public health authorities, the animal health authorities and the authorities in charge of vector surveillance and control should improve efficiency and save resources by implementing targeted measures. The creation of a formal interagency working group is identified as a crucial step towards integration. Blood safety is a key incentive for public health authorities to allocate sufficient resources for WNV surveillance, while the facts that an effective vaccine is available for horses and that most infected animals remain asymptomatic make the disease a lesser priority for animal health authorities. The examples described here can support other European countries wishing to strengthen their WNV surveillance or preparedness, and also serve as a model for surveillance and monitoring of other (vectorborne) zoonotic infections. © 2017, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={Introduction: Mosquito-borne diseases (MBDs) are spreading worldwide due to globalization and climate change, representing a threat for both humans and animals. Of great concern are the infections caused by viruses belonging to the Flavivirus genus as West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) transmitted by Culex sp. or Dengue virus and Zika virus (ZIKV), transmitted by Aedes sp. This work describes the surveillance protocol enforced in Piedmont (Northwestern Italy) to control MBDs spread, focusing on the activities performed on mosquitoes during the 2015 vector season. Materials and Methods: From July to October, mosquitoes were fortnightly sampled in 50 selected sites according to risk factors with CDC dry ice-baited traps and BG-Sentinel traps baited with BG-Lure and dry ice. Adults were counted, identified to species level, pooled, and screened for flaviviruses using different reverse transcription-PCR protocols and sequencing. Finally, phylogenetic analysis was performed on a dataset including 2014 and 2015 WNV sequences and reference sequences retrieved from GenBank. Results and Discussion: A total of 17,000 mosquitoes, grouped in 730 pools, were tested. Five pools of Culex pipiens were positive for WNV Lineage 2 in Novara, Alessandria, Vercelli, and Torino Provinces. One pool of C. pipiens and one pool of Anopheles maculipennis s.l. were positive for USUV in Vercelli and Alessandria Provinces. In Vercelli Province one pool of C. pipiens resulted positive both for WNV and USUV. Control measures were quickly implemented. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the WNV Lin 2 sequences from Piedmont region cluster with those circulating in Northeastern Italy in the previous years. Given the positive trend in WNV activity compared to 2014 and the emergence caused by other flavivirus as ZIKV, the level of attention for the 2016 vector season may be increased and this surveillance protocol could represent an important tool for public health authorities. © Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.},

abstract={All livestock transport within the European Union must comply with the EC Regulation 1/2005. For sheep, this law prescribes a maximum journey of 29 hours after which animals must rest in control posts (CP) for 24 hours before further transportation. However, there is no scientific evidence defining the effects of different stop duration on sheep recovery during long journeys. The aim of this study was to assess if a shorter stop could be provided without impairing ewes’ welfare. Ninety-six adult ewes were divided into 4 homogenous groups. One group stayed at the farm (control) and the other 3 were transported for 29 hours (long-transport, LT), stopped at CP for different times (8 hours (S8 group); 16 hours (S16 group); 24 hours (S24 group)) and were re-transported for 6 hours (short-transport, ST). Blood and saliva were collected to assess dehydration, muscular damage, and adrenocortical stress before departure, after LT, after the stop, and after ST. The LT affected the hydration of all transported groups (i.e. higher BUN/creatinine levels than controls, p < 0.001), but basal values were restored after the ST, regardless of the stop duration. After the ST, S8 group had higher muscular damage than the other groups (p < 0.05). No differences in stress level were observed. These results suggest that, in this trial, ewe’s welfare was not impaired by a stop reduction from 24 hours to 16 hours. © Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise 2017.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, particularly Culex spp. and Aedes/Ochlerotatus spp., which acquire the virus by feeding on viraemic birds. Humans, horses and other mammals are regarded as incidental or dead-end hosts. In the last decades, an increasing number of cases of WNV infection in horses and humans have been notified in the Mediterranean basin. In Tunisia, human cases of WNV-related meningoencephalitis were detected in 1997, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Based on the analysis of climatic and environmental conditions found in the locations where human cases have been reported in 2012, the aim of this study was to identify similar areas in Tunisia potentially at risk of disease occurrence. Data related to 85 neuroinvasive West Nile fever (WNF) human cases were georeferenced and a set of environmental and climatic variables (wetlands and humid areas, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), temperatures and elevation, migratory bird settlements) were used in the analysis. Areas, ecologically similar to those where human cases were detected, were identified using the Mahalanobis distance statistic. A leave-one-out cross-validation was performed to validate the sensitivity of the model, and 78 of 85 points were correctly classified. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Usutu (USUV) and West Nile (WNV) are mosquito-borne Flavivirus emerged in Italy in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and reappeared 10 years later. The aim of this work is to review the Italian mosquito species found positive for WNV and USUV between 2008 and 2014. Moreover, the role of mosquitoes in promoting the overwintering of these viruses is discussed, as a result of the mosquito collections performed in Molise region between September 2010 and April 2011. Overall 99,000 mosquitoes were collected: 337 and 457 mosquito pools tested positive by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) for WNV and USUV, respectively. West Nile virus was detected in pools of Culex pipiens s.l. (329), Ochlerotatus caspius (4), Culex modestus (2), and Culex spp. (2). Positive USUV pools were from Cx. pipiens s.l. (435), Aedes albopictus (12), Oc. caspius (5), Culex spp. (2), Anopheles maculipennis s.l. (1), Culiseta annulata (1), and Ochlerotatus detritus (1). In Molise region, 1,694 mosquitoes were collected, and USUV was identified in Cx. pipiens s.l., Cs. annulata, and Oc. detritus pools. This paper shows that Cx. pipiens s.l. is the mosquito species most involved in the WNV and USUV circulation in Italy, although other species would also support the spread of both the viruses during Winter. © Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise 2017.},

abstract={Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) are ectoparasites infesting livestock in every geographic area in the world and they are vectors of several viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens to animals and humans worldwide. A deep knowledge of the geographical distribution of these arthropods would have a key role in the control of tick-borne diseases. Few data are available about tick presence in domestic ruminants in Lebanon. The study aimed at providing an analysis of tick presence and distribution in Lebanon. Ticks were collected from cattle, sheep, and goats farms distributed in 6 Lebanese provinces between June and September 2014. A total of 272 adult hard ticks were randomly collected from domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats) located at 37 Lebanese farms, distributed among 30 villages. Ticks belonged to 4 Ixodidae genera: Rhipicephalus (72.4%), Haemaphysalis (11.4%), Dermacentor (8.1%), and Hyalomma (8.1%). They included the following species: Rhipicephalus annulatus (50.7%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (18.8%), Hyalomma anatolicum (8.1%), Haemaphylasis punctata (11.4%), Dermacentor marginatus (8.1%), Rhipicephalus sanguineus (2.5%), and Rhipicephalus bursa (0.4%). Rhipicephalus turanicus and H. anatolicum were found on cattle, sheep, and goats, R. annulatus on cattle and sheep, R. sanguineus, D. marginatus and Hea. punctata on sheep and goats, while R. bursa was collected only on sheep. Tick species involved in pathogen transmission were found and some of the identified species were recorded in Lebanon for the first time. © Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise 2017.},

abstract={Retail poultry meat is a crucial vehicle for consumers' exposure to Campylobacters, but no official controls are currently applied in Italy. The aim of this study was the evaluation of Campylobacter contamination of a wide range of poultry meats marketed in Italy. N. 472 chicken and turkey meat samples (sectioned meats, offal, meat preparations and products) were taken from slaughterhouses, deboning plants and different retailers and submitted to detection/enumeration of Campylobacter spp. The isolates were identified by phenotypic and biomolecular techniques. Campylobacter spp. was detected in 34.1% of the samples, with general low counts. Higher values were observed in offal (especially liver) and sectioned meats, with significantly higher rates in skin-on samples (86.8% vs 32.7%). Minced meat preparations showed lower prevalence (22.4% vs 58.3%) and counts than whole pieces. Decreasing rates were observed among slaughterhouses (80%), deboning plants (49%), butcher's shops (37%) and large scale retailers (25%). Sectioned chicken meats were significantly more contaminated than turkey meats. Almost all the isolates were identified as C. jejuni or C. coli, with similar prevalences (18.4% and 20.5%, respectively); C. jejuni was predominant only in samples from slaughterhouses/deboning plants. For setting future control programs, meat typology should be considered the main critical factor. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Animal welfare (AW) is a growing concern worldwide and veterinary students are expected to demonstrate a high degree of professional interest in the welfare of animals. However, previous studies have highlighted gaps in the teaching of AW teaching in different countries, possibly impairing veterinary competency in the area. This survey aimed to assess the opinions of Italian veterinary students towards AW, as well as their knowledge on the issue. Questions were divided into different sections, investigating the definition of, and information on, AW, knowledge about AW legislation, and the level of tolerance towards AW in regard to the use of animals for different purposes. Results showed that behaviour was the most frequently used word to define AW. Italian students considered their own level of knowledge on AW as good, relying on their university training, websites and television. They requested more AW legislation, but when questioned on specifics of the current legislation, there was a general lack of knowledge. Although poultry, pigs and rabbits were considered the species experiencing the worst management conditions, the species that raised the most AW concerns were companion animals and cattle. Results from this investigation may allow the development of tailored actions aimed at appropriately implementing educational strategies, at national and international levels, to improve the role of future veterinarians as leaders in AW. © 2017 British Veterinary Association.},

abstract={Background: Brucellosis is a common and chronic disease of cattle and other bovids that often causes reproductive disorders. Natural infection in cattle is caused by Brucella abortus and transmission typically occurs during abortions, calving, or nursing. Brucellosis is also a major zoonotic disease due to contamination of dairy products or contact with the tissues of infected animals. Brucellosis has been eradicated from most of the developed world in the last 40 years but persists in many regions - the disease remains prevalent in portions of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Central and South America, as well as in the Mediterranean basin. In Italy, B. abortus has persisted in southern regions in both cattle and water buffalo. Previous attempts at analyzing the phylogenetics of B. abortus in Italy have been challenging due to limited genetic variability and unresolved global population genetic structure of this pathogen. Results: We conducted genome-wide phylogenetic analyses on 11 representative strains of B. abortus from Italy, and compared these sequences to a worldwide collection of publically available genomes. Italian isolates belong to three clades that are basal to the main and global B. abortus lineage. Using six SNP-based assays designed to identify substructure within the Italian clades, we surveyed a collection of 261 isolates and found that one clade predominates throughout endemic districts in the country, while the other two clades are more geographically restricted to portions of southern Italy. Conclusions: Although related strains exist worldwide, B. abortus isolates from Italy are substantially different than those found in much of the rest of Europe and North America, and are more closely related to strains from the Middle East and Asia. Our assays targeting genetic substructure within Italy allowed us to identify the major lineages quickly and inexpensively, without having to generate whole genome sequences for a large isolate collection. These findings highlight the importance of genetic studies to assess the status and the history of pathogens. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Seven hundred seventy-eight samples of packaged smoked fish (774 smoked salmon and 4 smoked swordfish) on sale in Italy, from 50 different manufacturers located in 12 European Union countries, were purchased from the Italian market between May and December 2011. The surface temperatures of the samples on sale ranged from 0 to 13°C (3.4 ± 1.5°C, mean ± SD). Six hundred eighty (87.4%) of 778 samples were stored at ≤4°C. One hundred fifty-seven samples (20.2%, 95% confidence interval 17.5 to 23.1%) were contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes, with 26 samples (3.3%, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 4.8%) at levels &gt;100 CFU/g. The maximum level of contamination was 1.3×106 CFU/g. The differences in the level of contamination of smoked fish between countries (χ2 = 91.54, P &lt; 0.05) and manufacturers (χ2 = 193.22, P &lt; 0.05) were significant. The frequency of detection for products from different manufacturing premises ranged from 0 to 76.9%. Serotyping by serological agglutination revealed that the main serotypes detected were 1/2a (65.3%) and 1/2b (22.4%). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing with restriction enzymes AscI and ApaI yielded 36 pulsotypes from 144 isolates, clustering into 17 groups. Eight main pulsotypes accounted for 70.8% of the isolates. Three of the main pulsotypes were exclusively from products of a single manufacturer. In general, products from the same manufacturer showed genetic homogeneity, with one strongly prevalent pulsotype. Different manufacturers usually showed very different levels of contamination of the final product, confirming the importance of the management of process hygiene for controlling L. monocytogenes contamination. © 2017 International Association for Food Protection.},

abstract={Traditional Italian pork products can be consumed after variable drying periods, where the temporal decrease of water activity spans from optimal to inactivating values. This makes it necessary to A) consider the bias factor when applying culture-medium-based predictive models to sausage; B) apply the dynamic version (described by differential equations) of those models; C) combine growth and death models in a continuous way, including the highly uncertain growth/no growth range separating the two regions. This paper tests the applicability of published predictive models on the responses of Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica to dynamic conditions in traditional Italian pork sausage, where the environment changes from growth-supporting to inhibitory conditions, so the growth and death models need to be combined. The effect of indigenous lactic acid bacteria was also taken into account in the predictions. Challenge tests were carried out using such sausages, inoculated separately with L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica, stored for 480 h at 8, 12, 18 and 20 °C. The pH was fairly constant, while the water activity changed dynamically. The effects of the environment on the specific growth and death rate of the studied organisms were predicted using previously published predictive models and parameters. Microbial kinetics in many products with a long shelf-life and dynamic internal environment, could result in both growth and inactivation, making it difficult to estimate the bacterial concentration at the time of consumption by means of commonly available predictive software tools. Our prediction of the effect of the storage environment, where the water activity gradually decreases during a drying period, is designed to overcome these difficulties. The methodology can be used generally to predict and visualise bacterial kinetics under temporal variation of environments, which is vital when assessing the safety of many similar products. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vaccination is the most effective strategy for controlling Bluetongue virus (BTV) spread and economic consequences thereof. In this study we verified in sheep, using one commercially available inactivated vaccine for BTV-8 (BTVPUR AlSap 8), when, during the recommended vaccination schedule, animals start to be effectively protected against challenge with wild-type strain. To this aim, sheep were challenged at different time points shortly after the first vaccine injection. Twenty-four Sarda sheep were divided into four groups vaccinated two weeks before challenge (Group A), one week before challenge (Group B) and concurrently with challenge (Group C). A second vaccine was performed twenty-eight days later with respect the first vaccine administration in each experimental group. The last group consisted of six non vaccinated-infected animals (NVIA). Virological and serological examinations were performed before and after challenge up to 42 and 77 days post challenge, respectively. The results of the study show that vaccination commenced as little as two weeks before challenge (Group A) prevented viremia and RNAemia in challenged sheep altogether. Conversely, Group B was partially protected from challenge and Group C showed viraemia and RNAemia similar to NVIA. This study indicates that the first administration of inactivated vaccine performed two weeks before challenge was able to prevent viraemia. Overall, our findings may have direct consequences for the management of an unexpected BTV-8 outbreak in sheep and for the legislation on sheep trade from BTV restriction areas. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={In this study, the prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in poultry fresh meat and ready-to-cook products was evaluated. Seventy-three samples were collected at retail level from supermarkets and discount stores, obtaining 61.6% positivity. Of 133 Campylobacter isolates, 86 strains (Campylobacter coli, 58.1% and Campylobacter jejuni, 41.9%) were selected for characterisation on the basis of their SmaI and kpnI pulsed field gel-electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles, to exclude clonal replicates. Campylobacters resulted highly resistant to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid (79.1%, 72.1% and 65.1%, respectively); 50% of C. coli and 13.9% of C. jejuni were resistant to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, the most important antimicrobials for human campylobacteriosis therapy. Five C. coli were resistant to 5/7 of the tested antimicrobials. HS4c was the prevailing C. jejuni serotype group (22.3%), whereas 8 other serotypes were identified in low percentages. SmaI and kpnI profiles showed a wide variability. The survey showed a high Campylobacter contamination of poultry meat and poultry products at retail level in Tuscany, Italy. A wide strains’ heterogeneity and a remarkable level of strains’ antimicrobial resistance have been reported, confirming the need for an improvement of specific preventive measures along the production chain. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={Aggressiveness is reported to be the most important public health issue related to both owned and free-roaming dogs. Common approaches to assess canine aggressiveness are temperament tests. The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether one such test, the Socially Acceptable Behaviour (SAB) test, created to evaluate aggressive and fearful behaviour in dogs in the Netherlands, could be used reliably to assess dog aggression and fear in a population of owned dogs in Central Italy. Reactions to the test were recorded and compared to the owners’ perception of their dog’s aggressiveness using a validated questionnaire (C-BARQ). Dogs showing aggressive reactions during the test obtained significantly higher (more aggressive) scores on the C-BARQ subscales ‘stranger-directed aggression’ (SDA p < 0.001), ‘owner-directed aggression’ (ODA p = 0.03), and ‘familiar dog aggression’ (FDA p = 0.006), than dogs who did not react aggressively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that 7 of the SAB-subtests were predictive of the SDA score. The findings indicated that aggression directed toward unfamiliar people can be reliably assessed using the SAB test for a population of Italian pet dogs. © 2017, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={Objective To monitor the spread and to evaluate the role for public health of Usutu virus (USUV) in an endemic area of Italy. Methods The survey was retrospectively conducted by detecting USUV RNA and USUV antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum samples collected between 2008 and 2011 from 915 patients with or without neurologic impairments in the area of the municipality of Modena, Italy. Organs of birds and pools of mosquitoes were also tested for USUV RNA. Positive samples were partially sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis. Results The presence of USUV RNA (1.1%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6–2.0) was significantly (p <0.05) higher than that of West Nile virus (0%; 95% CI 0–0.33). USUV antibody level was 6.57% (95% CI 4.87–8.82), and it was significantly higher (p <0.05) compared to that of West Nile virus (p 2.96, 95% CI 1.89–4.62). Partial genome sequencing of USUV strains detected in humans, birds and mosquitoes revealed high nucleotide sequence identity within them and with the USUV strains isolated in Central Europe. Conclusions USUV infection in humans is not a sporadic event in the studied area, and USUV neuroinvasiveness has been confirmed. © 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases},

abstract={Despite being eradicated from Europe and probably the rest of the world, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) continues to plague sub-Saharan Africa affecting at least 25 countries, in particular Ethiopia, Ghana, Tanzania, Cameroon, Angola, Nigeria and Zambia. Evidence has shown that the causative agent, Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides, may have emerged from a closely related goat pathogen as recently as 300 years ago, which corresponds to the first description of CBPP in Europe. Numerous new vaccines have been produced over the last 20 years in an effort to improve on the protection afforded by the T1/44, a live vaccine in continuous use in Africa for over 60 years but none have so far succeeded; indeed, many have exacerbated the condition. In this review, we argue that the present tools for diagnosis and control are adequate for eradication and what is necessary are resources to improve vaccine coverage to levels of at least 80%, last seen in the 1970s when CBPP was restricted to very few countries of Africa. In addition, a study in Namibia supported the concept that strategic and targeted antimicrobial treatment can play a critical part in the control alongside regular and comprehensive vaccination. © CAB International 2017.},

abstract={Introduction. Adding stem cells to biodegradable scaffolds to enhance bone regeneration is a valuable option. Different kinds of stem cells with osteoblastic activity were tested, such as bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSSCs). Aim. To assess a correct protocol for osteogenic stem cell differentiation, so BMSSCs were seeded on a bone porcine block (BPB). Materials and Methods. Bone marrow from six minipigs was extracted from tibiae and humeri and treated to isolate BMSSCs. After seeding on BPB, critical-size defects were created on each mandible of the minipigs and implanted with BPB and BPB/BMSSCs. After three months, histomorphometric analysis was performed. Results. Histomorphometric analysis provided percentages of the three groups. Tissues present in control defects were 23 ± 2% lamellar bone, 28 ± 1% woven bone, and 56 ± 4% marrow spaces; in BPB defects were 20 ± 5% BPB, 32 ± 2% lamellar bone, 24 ± 1% woven bone, and 28 ± 2% marrow spaces; in BPB/BMSSCs defects were 17 ± 4% BPB/BMSSCs, 42 ± 2% lamellar bone, 12 ± 1% woven bone, and 22 ± 3% marrow spaces. Conclusion. BPB used as a scaffold to induce bone regeneration may benefit from the addition of BDPSCs in the tissue-engineered constructs. © 2017 Antonio Scarano et al.},

abstract={Field identification of European wood mice Apodemus spp. is challenging due to their morphological resemblance and frequent sympatry. We developed discriminant functions based on body mass and acoustic variables of distress calls to identify three cryptic species of wood mice (Apodemus alpicola, Apodemus flavicollis and Apodemus sylvaticus) in Italy. We achieved an overall correct classification rate of 86–98%; the best results (100% correct classification) were obtained for Apodemus sylvaticus calls. This minimally invasive, effective and low-cost method highlights the potential role of bioacoustics as a powerful tool for field discrimination of cryptic species of terrestrial mammals. © 2016 The Mammal Society and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={A total of 118 sera were collected during 2016 from two groups of dromedaries from Kebili and Medenine governorates in the south of Tunisia. The aim of this study was to provide the first serological investigation of four emerging vector-borne diseases in two groups of dromedaries in Tunisia. Sera were tested by ELISA and serum neutralisation test to identify West Nile virus (WNV), bluetongue virus (BTV), epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). In the first group, the seroprevalence for BTV was 4.6%, while in the second group, it was 25.8% for WNV and 9.7% for BTV. Only serotype 1 was detected for BTV in the two groups. No evidence for circulation of RVF and EHD viruses was revealed. Results indicated that dromedaries can be infected with BTV and WNV, suggesting that this species might play a significant role in the epizootiology of these viral diseases in Tunisia and neighbouring countries. © 2017.

abstract={The European Commission (EC) regulation no. 854/2004 requires a systematic monitoring of chemical and microbiological contaminants in live bivalve molluscs, live echinoderms, live tuni-cates and live marine gastropods for human consumption through surveillance plans to be implemented in all European Union (EU) countries. A consortium of five Adriatic countries was set up in the framework of the Instrument of Pre-accession Assistance Adriatic Cross-border Cooperation Programme (IPA Adriatic CBC) 20072013 with the aim of collecting data and distribute information on harvesting and production in mollusc areas. A web-based geographical information system (GIS) application was developed to support the partners to manage data and to make these data available to final users, policy makers and to risk assessors. The GIS for the Strengthening of Centres for Aquaculture Production and Safety surveillance in the Adriatic countries (CAPS2) is divided into two levels, the national and the supranational one, and it distributes spatial and epidemiological information coming from various data acquisition and management sites. The great innovation is the possibility for each country to use online drawing, modifying and change of the geographic areas according to national surveillance needs. Currently it hosts data coming from about 230 production and relay areas with more than 29,478 laboratory tests performed on collected samples since August 2014. Data collected are used by each national competent authority to classify production or relay areas according to the EC regulation mentioned and to conduct risk assessment studies to evaluate the level of consumers’ exposure to contaminants in the consumption of bivalve mollusc products. © S.

abstract={Canine distemper virus (CDV) represents an important conservation threat to many wild carnivores. A large distemper epidemic sustained by an Arctic-lineage strain occurred in Italy in 2013, mainly in the Abruzzi region, causing overt disease in domestic and shepherd dogs, Apennine wolves (Canis lupus) and other wild carnivores. Two badgers were collected by the end of September 2015 in a rural area of the Abruzzi region and were demonstrated to be CDV-positive by real time RT-PCR and IHC in several tissues. The genome of CDV isolates from badgers showed Y549H substitution in the mature H protein. By employing all publicly available Arctic-lineage H protein encoding gene sequences, six amino acid changes in recent Italian strains with respect to Italian strains of dogs from 2000 to 2008, were observed. A CDV strain belonging to the European-wildlife lineage was also identified in a fox found dead in the same region in 2016, proving co-circulation of an additional CDV lineage. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Three biodegradable thermoplastic polymers, poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (PLA) and poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), have been used to produce nonwovens scaffolds with uniform micrometer fibres. Scaffolds' physical and morphological characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Contact-Angle test. Morphological investigations revealed that all produced fibres were randomly orientated with interconnected pores ranging between 5 and 12 μm in diameter. An average fibre diameter of 1.5, 0.75 and 1.2 μm was found for PCL, PLA and PLGA, respectively. Moreover, experiments were designed to verify whether the fabricated electrospun substrates were biocompatible for ovine amniotic epithelial stem cells (oAECs) under in vitro conditions. Cell adhesion, survival, spatial organization on fibres, proliferation index, and DNA quantification after 48 h culture, showed an enhanced adhesion and proliferation, especially for PLGA scaffolds. The favourable interaction between oAECs and the fibrous scaffolds was attributed to the greatly improved porosity and pore size distribution of the electrospun scaffolds. In addition, AECs can be considered ideal for tissue engineering especially when using biocompatible and opportunely produced scaffolds. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii which infects humans as well as several animal species; sheep, goats and cattle are the primary animal reservoir. The main route of human exposure to Coxiella burnetii is inhalation of contaminated aerosols from excreta, especially birth products, while the role of unpasteurized dairy products in the transmission of Q fever to humans remains still controversial. The aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of Coxiella burnetii in unpasteurized cheese samples (n = 84) by PCR and to genotype the circulating strains by Multispacer sequence typing (MST) analysis. Coxiella burnetii DNA was detected in 27/84 (32.14%) cheeses and positivity rate of handicraft cheeses reached 17.24%, while positivity rate of non-handicraft cheeses reached 65.38%. In addition, the MST profile of Coxiella burnetii detected in 5 cheese samples have shown the circulation of ST12 and ST32 genotypes in Tuscany. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={During the period 2004–2014 in the Abruzzi region (Central Italy), muscle samples gathered from hunted wild boars (n = 16,323) and retrieved from carcasses of other susceptible wild mammals (n = 838) and birds (n = 438) were tested for Trichinella larvae according to European Union regulations. Although no positive samples were found from wild birds, 91 wild mammals tested positive. Six species were found to harbor Trichinella spp. infections, namely wolf (Canis lupus, 59 positive samples out of 218), red fox (Vulpes vulpes, 24/480), wild boar (Sus scrofa, 3/16,323), stone marten (Martes foina, 2/27), pine marten (Martes martes, 2/6) and wildcat (Felis silvestris, 1/8). All isolates tested for species attribution belonged to Trichinella britovi. The overall prevalence was 0.52% (IC 95%: 0.4–0.6). The higher frequency of positive samples in wolf, compared to red fox, was statistically significant (p = 0.001). In spite of the limited geographical area of investigation and the random nature of sampling, this study provides new data on the circulation of T. britovi in Italy. In particular, the highest prevalence being found among wolves allows us to consider this species as a sentinel for T. britovi infection in the investigated area, and probably also in other apennine regions, which is different from the alpine regions where the red fox was reputed as the primary reservoir of Trichinella spp. infection. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Rift Valley fever (RVF) is one of the most important zoonotic Transboundary Animal Diseases able to cross international borders and cause devastating effect on animal health and food security. Climate changes and the presence of competent vectors in the most of the current RVF-free temperate countries strongly support the inclusion of RVF virus (RVFV) among the most significant emerging viral threats for public and animal health. The transmission of RVFV is driven by complex eco-climatic factors making the epidemiology of RVF infection difficult to study and to understand. Mathematical, statistical and spatial models are often used to explain the mechanisms underlying these biological processes, providing new and effective tools to plan measures for public health protection. In this paper we performed a systematic literature review on RVF published papers with the aim of identifying and describing the most recent papers developing compartmental models for the study of RVFV transmission dynamics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years researchers have investigated a growing number of weighted heterogeneous networks, where connections are not merely binary entities, but are proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements. Different degree centrality measures have been proposed for this kind of networks. In this work we propose weighted degree and strength centrality measures (WDC and WSC). Using a reducing factor we correct classical centrality measures (CD) to account for tie weights distribution. The bigger the departure from equal weights distribution, the greater the reduction. These measures are applied to a real network of Italian livestock movements as an example. A simulation model has been developed to predict disease spread into Italian regions according to animal movements and animal population density. Model's results, expressed as infected regions and number of times a region gets infected, were related to weighted and classical degree centrality measures. WDC and WSC were shown to be more efficient in predicting node's risk and vulnerability. The proposed measures and their application in an animal network could be used to support surveillance and infection control strategy plans. © 2016 Candeloro et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.},

abstract={It is widely known that prion strains can mutate in response to modification of the replication environment and we have recently reported that prion mutations can occur in vitro during amplification of vole-adapted prions by Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification on bank vole substrate (bvPMCA). Here we exploited the high efficiency of prion replication by bvPMCA to study the in vitro propagation of natural scrapie isolates. Although in vitro vole-adapted PrPSc conformers were usually similar to the sheep counterpart, we repeatedly isolated a PrPSc mutant exclusively when starting from extremely diluted seeds of a single sheep isolate. The mutant and faithful PrPSc conformers showed to be efficiently autocatalytic in vitro and were characterized by different PrP protease resistant cores, spanning aa ∼155–231 and ∼80–231 respectively, and by different conformational stabilities. The two conformers could thus be seen as different bona fide PrPSc types, putatively accounting for prion populations with different biological properties. Indeed, once inoculated in bank vole the faithful conformer was competent for in vivo replication while the mutant was unable to infect voles, de facto behaving like a defective prion mutant. Overall, our findings confirm that prions can adapt and evolve in the new replication environments and that the starting population size can affect their evolutionary landscape, at least in vitro. Furthermore, we report the first example of “authentic” defective prion mutant, composed of brain-derived PrPC and originating from a natural scrapie isolate. Our results clearly indicate that the defective mutant lacks of some structural characteristics, that presumably involve the central region ∼90–155, critical for infectivity but not for in vitro replication. Finally, we propose a molecular mechanism able to account for the discordant in vitro and in vivo behavior, suggesting possible new paths for investigating the molecular bases of prion infectivity. © 2016 Vanni et al.},

abstract={Arboviruses cause acute diseases that increasingly affect global health. We used bluetongue virus (BTV) and its natural sheep host to reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism used by an arbovirus to manipulate host immunity. Our study shows that BTV, similarly to other antigens delivered through the skin, is transported rapidly via the lymph to the peripheral lymph nodes. Here, BTV infects and disrupts follicular dendritic cells, hindering B-cell division in germinal centers, which results in a delayed production of high affinity and virus neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the humoral immune response to a second antigen is also hampered in BTV-infected animals. Thus, an arbovirus can evade the host antiviral response by inducing an acute immunosuppression. Although transient, this immunosuppression occurs at the critical early stages of infection when a delayed host humoral immune response likely affects virus systemic dissemination and the clinical outcome of disease.},

abstract={In August 2008, after 10 years of apparent silence, West Nile virus (WNV) infection re-emerged in northern Italy, spreading through the territories of three regions. In the following years, new cases occurred in the same area and additional foci of infection were observed in central and southern Italy, involving also Sicily and Sardinia islands. The Italian Ministry of Health ordered to test by RT-PCR all blood and organ donors from 15th June to 15th November of each year in the infected areas. The period at risk of WNV transmission was defined on the basis of literature data, but a more scientific estimation of the transmission season, under Italian circumstances, needs to be performed. A transitional model previously developed by other Authors was applied and adapted to Italian circumstances, to describe and quantify the WNV transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes. Culex spp. was considered the main vector, and mosquito parameters were adapted to this genus. Magpies (Pica pica) were considered the main bird host. The model was partially validated through the results of the entomological surveys carried out in central Italy and in Po Valley. The results of the transitional model permitted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0 ) during 2010 for the whole Italian territory at 1 km of spatial resolution, estimating the risk of WNV transmission during the year and creating detailed risk maps for Italy. The mean values of R0 for the whole Italy varied between 0.4 and 4.8, with values >1 from the end of May to the middle of September. The coastal and flat zones of Italy showed the highest R0 values. Although partially validated, the model showed a substantial acceptable capacity of defining the period at major risk of WNV transmission in Italy, helping Public health authorities in the application of appropriate and timely control and preventive measures. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={In 2012 a US multistate outbreak of listeriosis was linked to ricotta salata imported from Italy, made from pasteurized sheep's milk. Sampling activities were conducted in Italy to trace the source of Listeria monocytogenes contamination. The cheese that caused the outbreak was produced in a plant in Apulia that processed semi-finished cheeses supplied by five plants in Sardinia. During an 'emergency sampling', 179 (23·6%) out of 758 end-products tested positive for L. monocytogenes, with concentrations from &lt;10 c.f.u./g to 1·1 × 106 c.f.u./g. Positive processing environment samples were found in two out of four processing plants. A 'follow-up sampling' was conducted 8 months later, when environmental samples from three out of six plants tested positive for L. monocytogenes and for Listeria spp. PFGE subtyping showed 100% similarity between US clinical strains and isolates from ricotta salata, confirming the origin of the outbreak. The persistence of strains in environmental niches of processing plants was demonstrated, and is probably the cause of product contamination. Two PFGE profiles from clinical cases of listeriosis in Italy in 2011, stored in the MSS-TESSy database, were found to have 100% similarity to one PFGE profile from a US clinical case associated with the consumption of ricotta salata, according to the US epidemiological investigation (sample C, pulsotype 17). However, they had 87% similarity to the only PFGE profile found both in the US clinical case and in 14 ricotta cheese samples collected during the emergency sampling (sample B, pulsotype 1). Sharing of molecular data and availability of common characterization protocols were key elements that connected the detection of the US outbreak to the investigation of the food source in Italy. Simultaneous surveillance systems at both food and human levels are a necessity for the efficient rapid discovery of the source of an outbreak of L. monocytogenes. © Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract={The decreased costs of genome sequencing have increased the capability to apply whole-genome sequencing to epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic Campylobacter jejuni. However, knowledge of the genetic diversity of this bacteria is vital for inferring relatedness between epidemiologically linked isolates and a necessary prerequisite for correct application of this methodology. To address this issue in C. jejuni we investigated the spatial and temporal signals in the genomes of a major clonal complex and generalist lineage, ST-45 CC, by analysing the population structure and genealogy as well as applying genome-wide association analysis of 340 isolates from across Europe collected over a wide time range. The occurrence and strength of the geographical signal varied between sublineages and followed the clonal frame when present, while no evidence of a temporal signal was found. Certain sublineages of ST-45 formed discrete and genetically isolated clades containing isolates with extremely similar genomes regardless of time and location of sampling. Based on a separate data set, these monomorphic genotypes represent successful C. jejuni clones, possibly spread around the globe by rapid animal (migrating birds), food or human movement. In addition, we observed an incongruence between the genealogy of the strains and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), challenging the existing clonal complex definition and the use of whole-genome gene-by-gene hierarchical nomenclature schemes for C. jejuni.},

abstract={In the framework of a European Union (EU) Coordinated Monitoring Programme, different types of ready-to eat (RTE) products, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 398) and cooked meat products (n = 403), were collected at retail in Italy and tested for detection and enumeration of Listeria monocytogenes. An Integrative Survey of 2696 samples, including soft and semi-soft cheese (n = 894) and cooked meat products (n = 1802) was carried out to have statistically representative results at the national level. Considering the results obtained both from the EU and the national Integrative Survey, prevalence of contamination of meat products was 1.66% (95% CL: 1.02–2.73%) at the arrival of the samples at the laboratory and 1.92% (95% CL: 1.31%–2.82%) at the end of shelf-life. Spalla cotta was the most frequently contaminated meat product. Prevalence of contamination in cheese was 2.13% (95% CL: 1.37%–3.3%) at the arrival at the laboratory and 1.01% (95% CL: 0.41%–2.55%) at the end of shelf-life. To get information about differences between cheese rinds and pastes, these two parts were separately analysed in the Integrative Survey samples. L. monocytogenes was detected in 4.02% (95% CL: 2.60%–6.19%) of cheese rinds (n = 473), whereas only the 0.34% (95% CL: 0.12%–0.98%) of cheese pastes (n = 894) were contaminated. This difference was statistically significant (χ2 = 10.026, P &lt; 0.05). Gorgonzola and Taleggio were the most frequently contaminated cheeses. Non-compliance with EU official criteria (100 CFU/g) was reported in 0.55% of meat products at arrival at the laboratory, in 0.46% at the end of shelf-life, and in 1.9% of cheese rinds. PFGE showed that cheese rinds could have been the origin of the few pastes' contamination, highlighting genetic similarity between isolates found in these two cheese components. Genetic subtyping also showed the presence of different pulsotypes, usually belonging to different clusters, in isolates from different food types. The presence of some pulsotypes predominantly prevalent over the others, in products from the same manufacturer, could suggest environmental strains as the main source of contamination. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Bovine brucellosis is an infectious disease of worldwide public health and economic importance. The usual tests for the diagnosis of this disease include the Rose-Bengal test (RBT), complement fixation test (CFT), serum agglutination test (SAT) and indirect ELISA. New tests such as competitive ELISAs (C-ELISA) and fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA) have been developed. However, C-ELISA may correspond to different protocols and a wide variation may exist in their diagnostic performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate three commercially available C-ELISA kits (C-ELISA1–3) and FPA for the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis and compare test performance with RBT, CFT, indirect ELISA and FPA. Sera submitted to EU laboratories in 2011 from 5111 adult cattle were tested. Individual test sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were estimated. Threshold assessment using the receiver operating characteristic method was also performed. The most sensitive tests were FPA (99.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 97.9-100%), C-ELISA1 (98.4%; 95% CI, 97.0-99.8%) and RBT (97.7%; 95% CI, 95.9-99.3%). The most specific tests were CFT (99.98%; 95% CI, 99.93-100%), SAT (99.98%; 95% CI, 99.93-100%) and RBT (99.89%; 95% CI, 99.79-99.99%). Among the new tests, none of the three C-ELISA kits studied could be recommended as a single screening test because of their low specificity, especially when used in a herd. C-ELISA3 could not be recommended as confirmatory test on individual animals to determine whether false positive serological test results had occurred. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In Italy a national Plan for the surveillance of imported and autochthonous human vector-borne diseases (chikungunya, dengue, Zika virus disease and West Nile virus (WNV) disease) that integrates human and veterinary (animals and vectors) surveillance, is issued and revised annually according with the observed epidemiological changes. Here we describe results of the WNV integrated veterinary and human surveillance systems in Italy from 2008 to 2015. A real time data exchange protocol is in place between the surveillance systems to rapidly identify occurrence of human and animal cases and to define and update the map of affected areas i.e. provinces during the vector activity period from June to October. WNV continues to cause severe illnesses in Italy during every transmission season, albeit cases are sporadic and the epidemiology varies by virus lineage and geographic area. The integration of surveillance activities and a multidisciplinary approach made it possible and have been fundamental in supporting implementation of and/or strengthening preventive measures aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of WNV trough blood, tissues and organ donation and to implementing further measures for vector control. © 2016, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

abstract={The Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is recognized as a powerful tool to improve laboratory data management and to report human health as well as veterinary public health. LIMS plays an essential role in public health surveillance, outbreak investigations, and pandemic preparedness. The chapter aims is to provide an overview of LIMS use in veterinary fields as well as to report 20 years of experience of a Veterinary Public Institute in working with LIMS, illustrating the features of the LIMS currently in use in the institute and highlighting the different aspects that should be considered when evaluating, choosing, and implementing a LIMS. In depth, the chapter illustrates how LIMS simplifies the accreditation path according to ISO IEC 17025 and the role in the epidemiology and veterinary public health. For this aspect, it is very important to collect clear data, and for this reason, a LIMS has to activate formal checks and controls on business rules. To facilitate this issue, an interconnection between LIMS and other applications (internal or external to laboratory) could be improved to allow automatic data exchange. At the same time, the unique data encoding at national/international level should be used. © 2017 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Phoridae, which belong to the Diptera order, were identified as the cause of serious infestations of Apis mellifera colonies in the American continent such as Phoridae from the genus “Melaloncha” in Central America and Apocephalus borealis in the USA. Some authors identified a novel phorid, Megaselia scalaris, as a possible parasitoid of honey bee in Brazil. Recently, in Europe, Diptera from the genus Megaselia was found able to parasitize adults of A. mellifera. So far, in the old continent, such infestation was reported only in bees dead or affected by other diseases, but never in healthy bees. From July through August 2014, the prevalence of myiases affecting A. mellifera was verified in Abruzzo and Molise regions. Most of the selected apiaries showed a great infestation of bees due to M. scalaris, even if they were apparently healthy, during trapping back from their foraging trip. Here, we report the results of our work to stress the impact that this parasitoid might have on health condition of beehive. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Cytosolic, globular droplets with an average diameter of 50 nm were observed in vitrified Thermoplasma acidophilum cells by means of cryo-electron tomography. These droplets were isolated by column chromatography and immunoprecipitation protein purification methods. Subsequent chemical and biochemical analyses identified lipid and protein components, respectively. Two major lipid components, comigrating menaquinones at the solvent front and the slower migrating Thermoplasma polar lipid U4, were detected by TLC experiments. The major protein component was identified as the 153 amino acid long Ta0547 vitellogenin-N domain protein. This domain has been found so far exclusively in large lipid transport proteins of vertebrates and non-vertebrates. Blast protein database homology searches with Ta0547 did not return any eukaryal hits; homologous sequences were found only in thermo-acidophilic archaeons. However, a profile-sequence domain search performed with the vitellogenin-N domain (PF01347) hmm-profile against the T. acidophilum proteome returned Ta0547 as hit. Electron microscopy appearance of isolated droplets resembled to lipoprotein particles. However, no (tetraether) lipid layer could be detected on the droplets surface, rather hydrophobic compounds of the electron dense lumen were surrounded by a denser discontinuous protein boundary. Based on described features, these particles qualify for a novel lipoprotein particle category, what we nominated Thermoplasma Quinone Droplet. © FEMS 2016. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The risk of Hg poisoning by eating seafood is considered real from the several international agencies that recommended, by fish consumption advisories, to pregnant women and young children to avoid or severely limit the consumption of the fish and shellfish with a high-range mercury levels. The analyses of two common species, European hake and Norway lobster, collected from an area of Central Adriatic Sea, reported high mercury levels in crustaceans. For Norway lobster total mercury exceeded, in six out of ten analysed pools, the recommended 0.5 mg/kg wet weight European limit. Moreover the increased amount of Hg concentrations in Norway lobster cooked samples suggests the necessity to review current procedures of Hg control in food, considering also consumption habits of consumers.

abstract={Following its first identification in Germany in 2011, the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has rapidly spread to many other European countries. Despite the wide dissemination, the molecular characterization of the circulating strains is limited to German, Belgian, Dutch, and Swiss viruses. To fill this gap, partial genetic characterization of 15 Italian field strains was performed, based on S segment genes. Samples were collected in 2012 in two different regions where outbreaks occurred during distinct epidemic seasons. The comparative sequence analysis demonstrated a high molecular stability of the circulating viruses; nevertheless, we identified several variants of the N and NSs proteins not described in other SBV isolates circulating in Europe. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={In this study, the development and validation of a multiresidue method for the detection of 11 quinolones (marbofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, danofloxacin, lomefloxacin, enrofloxacin, sarafloxacin, difloxacin, oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, flumequine) in muscle and eggs were reported. The method involved an extraction with a methanol/metaphosphoric acid mixture and a clean up by Oasis hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) cartridge. The validation was performed according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Linearity, specificity, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ), recovery, precision (repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility), and ruggedness were determined. Depending on the analytes, CCα and CCβ ranged from 113 to 234 μg/kg and from 126 to 282 μg/kg in muscle samples, whereas in eggs, these parameters were between 5.6 and 7.4 μg/kg and between 6.1 and 9.8 μg/kg, respectively. In both the examined matrices, the recovery values were always higher than 90 % and precision, calculated as relative standard deviation, was equal to or lower than 16 % for repeatability and 23 % for within-laboratory reproducibility. The described method can be considered adequate for the simultaneous determination and quantification of quinolones in the tested food matrices. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The aim of this study was to compare ochratoxin A (OTA) levels in pig tissues and biological fluids after animal exposure to contaminated diet (250 μg OTA/kg of feed) during 4 weeks of fattening. OTA concentrations were quantified using a validated immunoassay method (ELISA) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FD). The highest mean OTA concentration in pig tissues was determined in kidneys of exposed animals (13.87 ± 1.41 μg/kg), followed by lungs (10.47 ± 1.97 μg/kg), liver (7.28 ± 1.75 μg/kg), spleen (4.81 ± 0.99 μg/kg), muscle tissue (4.72 ± 0.86 μg/kg), fat tissue (4.11 ± 0.88 μg/kg), heart (3.71 ± 1.09 μg/kg), and brain (3.01 ± 0.25 μg/kg). Furthermore, on the last day of exposure (day 28), significantly higher mean OTA levels were determined in urine (16.06 ± 3.09 μg/L) in comparison to serum (4.77 ± 1.57 μg/L) showing that OTA urine analysis could be a good marker to identify elevated levels of this contaminant in porcine tissues used for human consumption. This study gave guidelines for the most efficient OTA control in pig-derived biological materials that can be exercised at slaughterhouses. © 2016, Society for Mycotoxin Research and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an infectious non-contagious viral disease transmitted by Culicoides, which affects wild and domestic ruminants. The disease has never been reported in Europe, however recently outbreaks of EHD occurred in the Mediterranean Basin. Consequently, the risk that Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) might spread in Italy cannot be ignored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of EHDV transmission in Italy, in case of introduction, through indigenous potential vectors. In Italy, the most spread and abundant Culicoides species associated to livestock are Culicoides imicola and the members of the Obsoletus complex. Culicoides imicola is a competent vector of EHDV, whereas the vector status of the Obsoletus complex has not been assessed yet. Thus, its oral susceptibility to EHDV was here preliminary evaluated. To evaluate the risk of EHDV transmission a geographical information system-based Multi-Criteria Evaluation approach was adopted. Distribution of vector species and host density were used as predictors of potential suitable areas for EHDV transmission, in case of introduction in Italy. This study demonstrates that the whole peninsula is suitable for the disease, given the distribution and abundance of hosts and the competence of possible indigenous vectors. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ’G.

abstract={Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is an emerging tick-borne zoonosis worldwide. As is the case for many tick-borne diseases, the epidemiological cycle is associated to the environmental conditions, including the presence of wild vertebrate reservoir hosts, vectors, climate and vegetation. In this study a total number of 87 spleen samples of wild ruminants carcasses from Central Italy, and 77 Ixodes ricinus collected from the same dead animals were screened for Anaplasma phagocytophilum by using Real Time PCR. A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected in 75%, 66.7% and 54.2% of the spleen samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus), Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) respectively, whereas it was detected in the 31.2% of I. ricinus. A total of 27 positive samples were characterized by sequencing a portion of the groEL gene. Two A. phagocytophilum lineages could clearly be delineated from the phylogenetic tree. Four sequences from red deer, 2 from I. ricinus and 1 from Apennine chamois clustered into lineage I together with those previously described as virulent genotypes related to HGA. The presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in the Apennine chamois represents the first report for this Italian endemic subspecies. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Summary Bluetongue, Schmallenberg and African horse sickness viruses are transmitted by vectors belonging to the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). Among this genus, species of the Obsoletus complex play a crucial role in Europe. In Italy the complex includes three species: Culicoides obsoletus sensu strictu, Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides montanus. These three sibling species were identified in 80 collection sites across Italy through a multiplex PCR test. Sixty‑four sites were classified with a predominant species through a Bayesian approach. Environmental, topographic and climatic factors together with landscape metrics were investigated in each species group using the non‑parametric Mann‑Whitney test. Culicoides obsoletus s.s. resulted the most widely distributed species across the peninsula (51 sites). This species was collected in many eco‑climatic conditions, at a wide range of temperature and altitudes, mainly in anthropogenic landscape. Conversely C. scoticus collection sites were dominated by natural vegetated areas or forest, at medium higher altitudes, preferably in a wilder and more pristine environment (predominant species in 8 sites). Culicoides montanus was a rarer species, statistically predominant in only 3 sites located in Southern Italy, characterized by temperatures higher than the other species. These results, together with other on‑going researches on the vector competence of the species belonging to the Obsoletus complex, and with investigation of larval and breeding habitats, could greatly improve epidemiological knowledge of possible spreading Culicoides‑borne viruses. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ’G.

abstract={In 2012, six years after the previous epidemic, Bluetongue virus serotype 1 (BTV-1) re-emerged in Sardinia causing a limited number of outbreaks. Due to impossibility of implementing a vaccination campaign, the BTV-1 then spread all over the island in 2013 with about 7,000 outbreaks and, in September 2013, the virus reached Central Italy, with a limited number of outbreaks located along the Tyrrhenian coast. The surveillance system in place in Italy detected viral circulation during the following winter, when a few seroconversions were notified. Starting from mid July 2014, a huge number of outbreaks were reported and the disease spread toward inland territories, affecting Umbria, Abruzzo and Marche. In 2014, BTV-1 affected areas where Culicoides species belonging to the Obsoletus and Pulicaris complexes were identified as main vectors. The analysis of temperature and rainfall in Central Italy revealed a significant warmer winter (2013-2014) and a cooler and rainy summer season (2014). These climatic aspects might have certainly favored the overwintering of the virus in local vector or host populations in the Tyrrhenian coast, and, then, the spread of the virus to the rest of Central Italy. However, the heavy circulation of BTV-1 and the severity of clinical outbreaks recorded leave a number of ‘open questions’ that are currently under investigations. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ’G.

abstract={Summary As Bluetongue virus (BTV) spread in Italy following its first incursion in 2000, it soon became apparent that, besides Culicoides imicola, additional species of the subgenus Avaritia were involved as vectors, namely one or more of the species that belong to the so-called ‘Culicoides obsoletus group’, which comprises C. dewulfi, C. chiopterus, C. obsoletus sensu stricto, C. scoticus and C. montanus; the three last named species are considered generally as forming the Obsoletus complex. This study presents the findings made over the last decade and more, within the Italian entomological surveillance program for Bluetongue. It describes the integrated morphological and molecular approach used to identify the species of the ‘C. obsoletus group’, maps in detail their relative abundances and geographic ranges in Italy, clarifies the hitherto unknown comparative seasonal abundances of C. obsoletus s.s. and C. scoticus in a site in Central Italy, and provides further details on the potential vector status of five species of the ‘C. obsoletus group’, with emphasis on C. obsoletus s.s., C. scoticus and C. montanus. Unlike the situation in Northern Europe, Culicoides dewulfi and C. chiopterus are uncommon to rare in Italy. In contrast, the Obsoletus complex occurs abundantly throughout Italy, with C. obsoletus s.s. being the most prevalent and ecologically adaptive of the three species making up the complex. A longitudinal study conducted at a site in Central Italy revealed that: (i) species of the Obsoletus complex prefer horses to sheep; (ii) their parity rates range from 10% (March) to 56% (November); (iii) throughout the year C. scoticus is consistently more abundant than C. obsoletus s.s.; (iv) abundances in both, C. obsoletus s.s. and C. scoticus, peak in May-June, with the peak of the latter species being more evident. Bluetongue virus was first isolated from wild caught midges of the Obsoletus complex in 2002. Thereafter, pools of selected parous midges collected across Italy, and during multiple outbreaks of BT, have been found consistently PCR-positive for the virus. More recently, viral RNA has been detected in field specimens of C. dewulfi, C. obsoletus s.s., C. scoticus and C. montanus. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ’G.

abstract={Bluetongue (BT) is considered endemic in several regions of Brazil. The State of Sao Paulo was divided into 7 cattle production regions (circuits) according the different systems of breeding, operational and logistical capacity of the state veterinary service. At least 1 animal from each property (a total of 1,716 farms) was tested by competitive ELISA for the presence of antibodies against BTV. Sero-positive sera were subsequently also tested by virus neutralization tests (VNT) using serial dilutions from 1:10 (cutoff) up to 1:640 (in MEM). BTV-4 neutralizing antibodies were detected in 86% (1,483/1,716) of the animals tested. These results show that BTV-4 is endemic and widespread in the State of San Paulo and indirectly confirm that in the State there are favourable conditions for the multiplication of competent vectors. However, as no clinical signs have ever been reported in cattle in the region, BTV-4 infection is likely to occur silently in the State of Sao Paulo. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ’G.

abstract={Mankind directly controls the environment and lifestyles of several domestic species for purposes ranging from production and research to conservation and companionship. These environments and lifestyles may not offer these animals the best quality of life. Behaviour is a direct reflection of how the animal is coping with its environment. Behavioural indicators are thus among the preferred parameters to assess welfare. However, behavioural recording (usually from video) can be very time consuming and the accuracy and reliability of the output rely on the experience and background of the observers. The outburst of new video technology and computer image processing gives the basis for promising solutions. In this pilot study, we present a new prototype software able to automatically infer the behaviour of dogs housed in kennels from 3D visual data and through structured machine learning frameworks. Depth information acquired through 3D features, body part detection and training are the key elements that allow the machine to recognise postures, trajectories inside the kennel and patterns of movement that can be later labelled at convenience. The main innovation of the software is its ability to automatically cluster frequently observed temporal patterns of movement without any pre-set ethogram. Conversely, when common patterns are defined through training, a deviation from normal behaviour in time or between individuals could be assessed. The software accuracy in correctly detecting the dogs' behaviour was checked through a validation process. An automatic behaviour recognition system, independent from human subjectivity, could add scientific knowledge on animals' quality of life in confinement as well as saving time and resources. This 3D framework was designed to be invariant to the dog's shape and size and could be extended to farm, laboratory and zoo quadrupeds in artificial housing. The computer vision technique applied to this software is innovative in non-human animal behaviour science. Further improvements and validation are needed, and future applications and limitations are discussed. © 2016 Barnard et al.

abstract={The ecological knowledge of large rivers is still scarce or highly fragmented mainly because of complex, laborious and expensive procedures to collect informative samples from the benthic biota. Standard sampling protocols for macroinvertebrates were mainly developed and calibrated for wadeable streams, while a number of heterogeneous non-standard sampling procedures are available for large rivers. We propose the new, easy-to-build and cost-effective leaf-nets (LN) method to quantitatively sample benthic invertebrates in non-wadeable waterways. The LN method uses Phragmites australis leaves as substrate and combines the characteristics of the leaf-bags and the Hester–Dendy (HD) multiplates methods. We compared the effectiveness of the LN and HD methods in a near-pristine and in an impacted stream-reach (downstream an aquaculture plant) of a non-wadeable second-order stream of Central Apennines (Italy). Twenty-five of the 34 cumulatively collected macroinvertebrate taxa were common to both methods, while seven taxa were found only on LN and two only on HD. Taxonomic richness and total macroinvertebrate abundance were higher for LN assemblages. Number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa (EPT) also tended to be higher on LN. Assemblage composition was different on LN and HD. Both methods documented a significant decrease in EPT taxa and a concomitant increase in the total abundance of more pollution-tolerant taxa in the impacted stream-reach, but the LN method was more sensitive to impact-associated changes in macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. In contrast to the hardboard plates of HD, the assembled leaves of the LN may act as a direct or indirect food source and may better mimic the texture and composition of more heterogeneous natural substrates thus favouring the migration–colonization process from both bottom and littoral benthic invertebrates. The sampling efficiency, cost effectiveness and simplicity warrant the routine use of the new LN method in large-river ecological assessment. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

abstract={Prioritization of companion animal transmissible diseases was performed by the Companion Animals multisectoriaL interprofessionaL Interdisciplinary Strategic Think tank On zoonoses (CALLISTO) project. The project considered diseases occurring in domesticated species commonly kept as pets, such as dogs and cats, but also included diseases occurring in captive wild animals and production animal species. The prioritization process led to the selection of 15 diseases of prime public health relevance, agricultural economic importance, or both. An analysis was made of the current knowledge on the risk of occurrence and transmission of these diseases among companion animals, and from companion animals to man (zoonoses) or to livestock. The literature was scanned for risk assessments for these diseases. Studies were classified as import risk assessments (IRAs) or risk factor analyses (RFAs) in endemic areas. For those pathogens that are absent from Europe, only IRAs were considered; for pathogens present throughout Europe, only RFAs were considered. IRAs were identified for seven of the eight diseases totally or partially absent from Europe. IRAs for classical rabies and alveolar echinococcosis found an increased risk for introduction of the pathogen into officially disease-free areas as a consequence of abandoning national rules and adopting the harmonized EU rules for pet travel. IRAs for leishmaniosis focused on risk associated with the presence of persistently infected dogs in new geographical areas, taking into consideration the risk of disease establishment should a competent vector arise. IRAs for Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever and West Nile fever indicated that the likelihood of introduction via companion animals was low. IRAs for bluetongue paid no attention to the risk of introduction via companion animals, which was also the case for IRAs for foot-and-mouth disease, the only disease considered to be absent from Europe. RFAs dealing with the risk factors for companion animals to become infected were identified for eight of the 14 diseases found in Europe or parts of it. RFAs for leptospirosis were most numerous (four studies). The host related risk factor ‘age’ was identified as significant for dogs in at least two RFAs for cystic echinococcosis and giardiasis. Among husbandry and healthcare related factors, ‘eating (uncooked) offal’, ‘being free roaming’ and ‘poor deworming practice’ were associated with risk for dogs in at least two RFAs for cystic echinococcosis, while ‘having received recent veterinary treatment’ was identified as a risk factor in at least two studies on infection with extended spectrum beta lactamase-producing bacteria, one in horses and the other in dogs and cats. Finally, although the environmental factors 'season’ and ‘hydrological density’ were identified as significant risk factors for dogs in at least two RFAs for leptospirosis, the inconsistent case definitions used in those studies made comparison of study results problematic. RFAs considering the risk of people becoming infected from companion animals were identified for eight of the 14 diseases found in Europe or parts of it. RFAs for human campylobacteriosis were the most numerous (n = 6). Most studies made an assessment as to whether keeping a pet per se, or keeping a pet with supposed or known risk factors, was a risk factor for people relative to other risks. This allowed some studies to report the population attributable risk or population attributable fraction of the incidence of human disease due to companion animals (for campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and toxoplasmosis), which is a measure that is easy to perceive for laymen and policy makers. No RFAs were found that dealt with the risk to food animals from companion animals for any of the 15 pathogens investigated. Few risk method-based studies were identified that provided information on risk factors for companion animals and on their role as a source of these 15 selected diseases, indicating a clear knowledge gap. There were not enough assessments for any of the 15 diseases to allow meta-analyses, whether these assessments dealt with companion animal disease risk or companion animal-associated human disease risk. Important method and technology gaps were the lack of harmonization in the case definitions used for a given disease and the lack of good diagnostics allowing pathogen identification to taxonomic levels that are meaningful for risk analysis. Molecular epidemiology studies on zoonotic pathogens, which included companion animals among the potential human risk factors, were not found, although such studies would provide good preliminary insights without requiring any tracing of people or any interviews. In addition to performing further risk studies that take into account these issues, there is a need for responsible pet ownership and continued education of professionals in companion animal zoonoses. Additional risk assessment studies should allow more targeted actions to reduce the risk of zoonotic diseases transferred via companion animals and provide information that will promote risk-awareness in healthy human–animal relationships. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={A number of papers have been published on the prioritization of transmissible diseases in farm animals and wildlife, based either on semiquantitative or truly quantitative methods, but there is no published literature on the prioritization of transmissible diseases in companion animals. In this study, available epidemiological data for diseases transmissible from companion animals to man were analysed with the aim of developing a procedure suitable for their prioritization within a European framework. A new method and its associated questionnaire and scoring system were designed based on methods described by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Modifications were applied to allow for the paucity of specific information on companion animal transmissible diseases. The OIE method was also adapted to the subject and to the regional scope of the interprofessional network addressing zoonotic diseases transmitted via companion animals in Europe: the Companion Animals multisectoriaL interprofessionaL Interdisciplinary Strategic Think tank On zoonoses (CALLISTO). Adaptations were made based on information collected from expert groups on viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases using a structured questionnaire, in which all questions were closed-ended. The expert groups were asked to select the most appropriate answer for each question taking into account the relevance and reliability of the data available in the scientific literature. Subsequently, the scoring of the answers obtained for each disease covered by the questionnaire was analysed to obtain two final overall scores, one for human health impact and one for agricultural economic impact. The adapted method was then applied to select the 15 most important pathogens (five for each pathogen group: viral, bacterial and parasitic) on the basis of their overall impact on public health and agriculture. The result of the prioritization exercise was a joint priority list (available at www.callistoproject.eu) of relevant pathogens according to these two criteria. As the scope of CALLISTO was comprehensive in terms of geographical area, animal species involved and impact of the diseases, the list of prioritized diseases had to accommodate the realities in different European countries and the differences in biology and animal–human relationships in a wide range of species including cats and dogs, pet pigs and sheep as well as captive reptiles. The methodology presented in this paper can be used to generate accurate priority lists according to narrower and more specific objectives. © 2015 The Authors},

abstract={Summary Bluetongue (BT) is a mild to severe disease of domestic and wild ruminants caused by the Bluetongue virus (BTV) and generally transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. Its occurrence also determines a livestock trade ban in affected countries with severe economic consequences on national and international trade. For this reason, in May 2011, the OIE encouraged the OIE Reference Laboratories to establish and maintain a BT network to provide expertise and training to the OIE and OIE Member Countries for BT diagnosis, surveillance and control. The network is constantly sustained by world leading scientists in the field of virology, epidemiology, serology, entomology and vaccine development. The website, available at http://oiebtnet.izs.it/btlabnet/, hosts an Information System containing data on BTV outbreaks and strains and a WebGIS that distributes maps on BTV occurrence. In this paper we describe the applications and present the benefits derived from the use of the WebGIS in the context of BT international surveillance network. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ’G.

abstract={The role of the northward expansion of Culicoides imicola Kieffer in recent and unprecedented outbreaks of Culicoides-borne arboviruses in southern Europe has been a significant point of contention. We combined entomological surveys, movement simulations of air-borne particles, and population genetics to reconstruct the chain of events that led to a newly colonized French area nestled at the northern foot of the Pyrenees. Simulating the movement of air-borne particles evidenced frequent wind-transport events allowing, within at most 36 hours, the immigration of midges from north-eastern Spain and Balearic Islands, and, as rare events, their immigration from Corsica. Completing the puzzle, population genetic analyses discriminated Corsica as the origin of the new population and identified two successive colonization events within west-Mediterranean basin. Our findings are of considerable importance when trying to understand the invasion of new territories by expanding species.},

abstract={Serial passage of viruses in cell culture has been traditionally used to attenuate virulence and identify determinants of viral pathogenesis. In a previous study, we found that a strain of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) serially passaged in tissue culture (termed SBVp32) unexpectedly displayed increased pathogenicity in suckling mice compared to wild-type SBV. In this study, we mapped the determinants of SBVp32 virulence to the viral genome M segment. SBVp32 virulence is associated with the capacity of this virus to reach high titers in the brains of experimentally infected suckling mice. We also found that the Gc glycoprotein, encoded by the M segment of SBVp32, facilitates host cell protein shutoff in vitro. Interestingly, while the M segment of SBVp32 is a virulence factor, we found that the S segment of the same virus confers by itself an attenuated phenotype to wild-type SBV, as it has lost the ability to block the innate immune system of the host. Single mutations present in the Gc glycoprotein of SBVp32 are sufficient to compensate for both the attenuated phenotype of the SBVp32 S segment and the attenuated phenotype of NSs deletion mutants. Our data also indicate that the SBVp32 M segment does not act as an interferon (IFN) antagonist. Therefore, SBV mutants can retain pathogenicity even when they are unable to fully control the production of IFN by infected cells. Overall, this study suggests that the viral glycoprotein of orthobunyaviruses can compensate, at least in part, for the function of NSs. In addition, we also provide evidence that the induction of total cellular protein shutoff by SBV is determined by multiple viral proteins, while the ability to control the production of IFN maps to the NSs protein. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the causative agent of bluetongue, a major infectious disease of ruminants with serious consequences to both animal health and the economy. The clinical outcome of BTV infection is highly variable and dependent on a variety of factors related to both the virus and the host. In this study, we show that the BTV nonstructural protein NS4 favors viral replication in sheep, the animal species most affected by bluetongue. In addition, NS4 confers a replication advantage on the virus in interferon (IFN)-competent primary sheep endothelial cells and immortalized cell lines. We determined that in cells infected with an NS4 deletion mutant (BTV8ΔNS4), there is increased synthesis of type I IFN compared to cells infected with wild-type BTV-8. In addition, using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we show that NS4 modulates the host IFN response and downregulates mRNA levels of type I IFN and interferon-stimulated genes. Moreover, using reporter assays and protein synthesis assays, we show that NS4 downregulates the activities of a variety of promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, the IFN-β promoter, and a promoter containing interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE). We also show that the NS4 inhibitory activity on gene expression is related to its nucleolar localization. Furthermore, NS4 does not affect mRNA splicing or cellular translation. The data obtained in this study strongly suggest that BTV NS4 is an IFN antagonist and a key determinant of viral virulence. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Background: Human brucellosis cases are still reported each year in Sweden despite eradication of the disease in animals. Epidemiological investigation has never been conducted to trace back the source of human infection in the country. The purpose of the study was to identify the source of infection for 16 human brucellosis cases that occurred in Sweden, during the period 2008-2012. Results: The isolates were identified as Brucella melitensis and MLVA-16 genotyping revealed 14 different genotypes of East Mediterranean and Africa lineages. We also reported one case of laboratory-acquired brucellosis (LAB) that was shown to be epidemiological linked to one of the cases in the current study. Conclusions: Brucella melitensis was the only species diagnosed, confirming its highest zoonotic potential in the genus Brucella, and MLVA-16 results demonstrated that the cases of brucellosis in Sweden herein investigated, are imported and linked to travel in the Middle East and Africa. Due to its zoonotic concerns, any acute febrile illness linked to recent travel within those regions should be investigated for brucellosis and samples should be processed according to biosafety level 3 regulations. © 2016 The Author(s).},

Epidemiological, microbiological and environmental investigations were conducted to try to identify the outbreak source. Cases were interviewed using a standardised questionnaire and microbiological tests were performed on human as well as environmental samples, including samples from fruit and vegetables, pigs, and surface water. Investigation results did not identify the final vehicle of human infection, although a link between the human cases and the contamination of irrigation water channels was suggested. © 2016, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The project aims to create common knowledge, sharing data, expertise, experiences, and scientific information on West Nile Disease (WND), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Rift Valley fever (RVF). These arthropod-borne diseases of domestic and wild animals can affect humans, posing great threat to public health. Since November 2011, when the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been discovered for the first time in Northern Europe, the Arbo-zoonet Information System has been used in order to collect information on newly discovered disease and to manage the epidemic emergency. The system monitors the geographical distribution and epidemiological evolution of CCHF, RVF, and WND since 1946. More recently, it has also been deployed to monitor the SBV data. The Arbo-zoonet Information System includes a web application for the management of the database in which data are stored and a WebGIS application to explore spatial disease distributions, facilitating the epidemiological analysis. The WebGIS application is an effective tool to show and share the information and to facilitate the exchange and dissemination of relevant data among project’s participants. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) circulation dynamics in the context of the urban environment is not yet elucidated. In this perspective, three groups of eight rock pigeons (Columbia livia) were inoculated with three WNV lineage 1 strains isolated in Italy between 2009 and 2012. The pigeons did not develop any clinical signs consistent with WNV acute infection. All animals seroconverted and shed virus up to 15 days post-infection by the oral or cloacal routes. In all infected groups viraemia lasted for 4 days post-infection. No WNV-specific gross or histological lesions were found in infected birds compared to control birds and immunohistochemistry remained constantly negative from all tissues. The reservoir competence index was also assessed and it ranged between 0·11 and 0·14. This study demonstrates that pigeons are competent reservoir hosts for Italian WNV lineage 1 circulating strains thus potentially posing a risk to the public health system. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2015.},

abstract={Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and represents a major threat to small livestock industry. In recent years, outbreaks of PPR have occurred in Turkey and North Africa. In endemic areas, disease prevention is accomplished using live-attenuated vaccines. However, the use of live vaccines in non-endemic regions, such as Europe, is not approved by Veterinary Authorities. In these regions inactivated vaccines are then the only viable alternative. In this study an inactivated vaccine (iPPRVac) was formulated with either a water-in-oil emulsion (ISA 71 VG) or with delta inulin adjuvant, alone (AFSA1) or combined with a TLR9 agonist oligonucleotide (AFSA2). These formulations were then tested for immunogenicity on rats. The iPPRV formulation with AFSA2 adjuvant induced 100% seroconversion in rats after 2 injections and was subsequently evaluated in goats. Five goats were immunised twice subcutaneously, 36 days apart with iPPRVac + AFSA2. The immunised goats all seroconverted to PPR by day 9 and remained seropositive until the end of the experimental period (133 days). These data indicate that the rat model is useful in predicting vaccine responses in goats and that inactivated vaccine, when formulated with a delta inulin adjuvant, represents a promising alternative to live attenuated vaccines for PPR vaccination campaigns in non-endemic areas. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={The immunogenicity of two inactivated bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccines was evaluated in 880 cattle under field conditions. The effect of selected factors on vaccine performance was also analysed at the herd and animal levels (vaccine, herd size and production, age, sex, time interval between vaccination and blood sampling and veterinary training). The immunogenicity elicited by vaccination with the two vaccines was monitored with the aid of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and serum neutralization test (SNT). To investigate whether the selected factors influenced seroconversion at the herd and animal levels, a multilevel logistic regression model developed in a mixed model was applied. Of the 880 cattle vaccinated, 76.0% yielded BTV c-ELISA antibodies, whereas only 25.0% seroconverted based on SNT. Type of vaccine (odds ratio [OR] 4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-9.0 for SNT and OR 3.5; 95% CI, 2.1-5.9 for c-ELISA), veterinary training in vaccine administration (OR 8.1; 95% CI, 4.7-14.1 for SNT and OR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.3-4.2 for c-ELISA), animal age (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8 for SNT and OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.1 for c-ELISA) and days between first vaccine administration and blood collection (OR 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1 for SNT and OR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.7-3.8 for c-ELISA) were the major factors affecting vaccine performance under field conditions.

abstract={In 2011, several outbreaks of West Nile disease occurred in Sardinia (Italy). The region hosts several chelonian species. Because of the increasing concern on the potential role that ectotherms may play in the ecology of West Nile virus (WNV), in October 2011 blood samples were collected from 41 endemic Sardinian chelonians and tested for the presence of active WNV infection or neutralizing antibodies by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serumneutralisation, respectively. Neither WNV neutralising antibodies (0%; 95% CI: 0-8.4%) nor WNV RNA (0%; 95% CI: 0-6.8%) were found in the tested samples. According to the results of this screening survey, it is unlikely that chelonians are involved in the epidemiology of the 2011 WNV outbreaks in Sardinia. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={Nowadays, leptospirosis is a re-emerging widespread infectious disease often underestimate worldwide. The National Reference Centre for Leptospirosis (NRCL), at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell’Emilia Romagna, Brescia (Italy), with the cooperation of all the other Istituti Zooprofilattici Sperimentali (IIZZSS), evaluated the distribution of such important zoonosis in Italy. Serological data obtained between 2010-2011 by each laboratory were collected by the NRCL and discussed. Serum samples collected from 43,935 animal specimens were analysed by the Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT), using a panel of 8 serogroups as antigens (Australis, Ballum, Canicola, Grippotyphosa, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, Sejroe, Tarassovi). A MAT cut-off of 1:100 was used to identify the serological positivities, 6,279 sera showed positive titers. Bovine (46.9%), swine (27.5%), ovine and goat (7.4%), dog (6.9%), and wild boar (4.5%) samples were delivered to the Laboratories more frequently than equine and other species sera. Data analysis showed that the most common serogroups in Italy are: Australis present in dogs, wild boars, horses, hares, swine, foxes, and rodents; Sejroe detected in cattle, sheep, goats, and buffaloes; Icterohaemorrhagiae present in dogs, goats, and foxes; Pomona detected in swine, cattle, and wild species; Grippotyphosa reported in hares. © 2016, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an arthropod-borne infectious viral disease sustained by the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). The only commercially available and currently used vaccines are manufactured for EHDV-2 in Japan, either live or inactivated vaccines. In this study we tested the innocuity for fetuses of the live attenuated EHDV-2 vaccine in five late-term pregnant cows. Whole blood and serum samples were collected from dams and screened for the presence of EHDV-2 RNA, infectious virus and antibodies. After calving, whole blood and serum samples collected from calves, before and after colostrum intake, were also tested for antibodies and for virus detection. In dams, neither fever nor clinical signs were observed. All of them seroconverted and a strong humoral response was detected throughout the sampling period. All blood samples tested negative for EHDV-2 except for one sample collected from a dam 11 days post-vaccination which tested positive at virus isolation at the third cell passage following two rounds of blind passages. Although they had free access to colostrum, calves tested serologically negative for EHDV-2 during the entire course of the experiment. Overall, the tested live attenuated vaccine can be safely administered to late-term pregnant cows as it was not demonstrated to cross the placental barrier. The safety of the live-attenuated vaccine is further confirmed by the emergence of Ibaraki virus in 2013 in Japan which is apparently not related to the spread of the vaccine strain currently used in Japan. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Introduction of vector species into new areas represents a main driver for the emergence and worldwide spread of vector-borne diseases. This poses a substantial threat to livestock economies and public health. Culicoides imicola Kieffer, a major vector species of economically important animal viruses, is described with an apparent range expansion in Europe where it has been recorded in south-eastern continental France, its known northern distribution edge. This questioned on further C. imicola population extension and establishment into new territories. Studying the spatio-temporal genetic variation of expanding populations can provide valuable information for the design of reliable models of future spread. Methods: Entomological surveys and population genetic approaches were used to assess the spatio-temporal population dynamics of C. imicola in France. Entomological surveys (2-3 consecutive years) were used to evaluate population abundances and local spread in continental France (28 sites in the Var department) and in Corsica (4 sites). We also genotyped at nine microsatellite loci insects from 3 locations in the Var department over 3 years (2008, 2010 and 2012) and from 6 locations in Corsica over 4 years (2002, 2008, 2010 and 2012). Results: Entomological surveys confirmed the establishment of C. imicola populations in Var department, but indicated low abundances and no apparent expansion there within the studied period. Higher population abundances were recorded in Corsica. Our genetic data suggested the absence of spatio-temporal genetic changes within each region but a significant increase of the genetic differentiation between Corsican and Var populations through time. The lack of intra-region population structure may result from strong gene flow among populations. We discussed the observed temporal variation between Corsica and Var as being the result of genetic drift following introduction, and/or the genetic characteristics of populations at their range edge. Conclusions: Our results suggest that local range expansion of C. imicola in continental France may be slowed by the low population abundances and unsuitable climatic and environmental conditions. © 2016 Jacquet et al.},

abstract={Circoviruses are relatively novel pathogens with increased importance in canids. In this study, we first screened the presence of dog circovirus (DogCV) by molecular methods from a total number of 389 internal organ samples originating from 277 individuals of domestic dogs and wild animals including wolves, foxes and badgers. All the animals originated from Central-Southern Italy, specifically from Abruzzi and Molise regions, areas hosting several natural parks. DogCV was detected in 9/34 wolves (P=26.4%; IC 95%: 14.6-43.1%), 8/209 dogs (P=3.8%; IC 95%: 1.9-7.3%), 0/24 foxes (P=0%; IC 95%: 0-13.8%), 1/10 badgers (P=10%; IC 95%: 1.79-40.4%). However, all DogCV positive animals were shown to be infected at least by an additional key pathogen, including canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine parvovirus type 2. All wolves, but one, presenting DogCV in the internal tissues suffered from CDV infection. The DNA purified from 17 DogCV infected organs was used for whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were determined in various foodstuffs in Italy and the dietary intake was estimated. PBDEs were detected in all analysed samples at concentrations that spanned over five orders of magnitude. The most abundant congeners were the BDE-209, followed by BDE-47 and BDE-99. Fish oil and milk samples showed the highest PBDE concentrations among all samples. The daily dietary intake values were found to be in good agreement or higher to literature values, impacted mainly from the contribution of the analysed dairy products. The cancer risk values estimated for BDE-209 indicated that this specific risk associated with the studied foodstuffs is limited.Italy is one of the world-leading countries in the production of furniture and clothes and has extremely developed medium enterprise industrial sector, where PBDEs were historically used suggesting that their occurrence may be linked to these activities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a severe respiratory disease, is characterized by massive inflammation of the lung especially during the acute clinical stage of infection. Tissue samples from cattle, experimentally infected with Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides Afadé, were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical examination in order to provide insight into innate immune pathways that shape inflammatory host responses. Lung lesions were characterized by vasculitis, necrosis, and increased presence of macrophages and neutrophils, relative to uninfected animals. The presence of three cytokines associated with innate inflammatory immune responses, namely, IL-1β, IL-17A, and TNF-α, were qualitatively investigated in situ. Higher cytokine levels were detected in lung tissue samples from CBPP-affected cattle compared to samples derived from an uninfected control group. We therefore conclude that the cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β, which are prevalent in the acute phase of infections, play a role in the inflammatory response seen in the lung tissue in CBPP. IL-17A gets released by activated macrophages and attracts granulocytes that modulate the acute phase of the CBPP lesions. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii and Brucella spp. can infect a wide range of species, including humans. In cetaceans, meningoencephalitis has been associated with T. gondii and Brucella spp. infection, whereas to our knowledge, L. monocytogenes infection has not previously been reported. Meningoencephalitis and L. monocytogenes, T. gondii and Brucella spp. were identified by means of both direct and indirect laboratory techniques in an adult female striped dolphin Stenella coeruleoalba found stranded in January 2015 on the Ligurian Sea coast, northwestern Italy. The animal was emaciated, and histopathology disclosed severe meningoencephalitis. The nature of the inflammatory response and intra-lesional protozoa were consistent with a mixed infection by L. monocytogenes, T. gondii and Brucella spp. We believe this is an unprecedented case of infection by 3 zoonotic pathogens and also the first bacteriologically confirmed case report of neurolisteriosis in cetaceans. Cerebral toxoplasmosis and neurobrucellosis may have led to the animal's disorientation and stranding, with L. monocytogenes having likely exacerbated the coinfection leading to the demise of this dolphin. © Inter-Research 2016.},

abstract={Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strains possess a large accessory genome composed of virulence genes existing in multiple allelic variants, which sometimes segregate with specific STEC subpopulations. We analyzed the allelic variability of 91 virulence genes of STEC by Real Time PCR followed by melting curves analysis in 713 E. coli strains including 358 STEC. The 91 genes investigated were located on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), OI-57, and OI-122 pathogenicity islands and displayed a total of 476 alleles in the study population. The combinations of the 91 alleles of each strain were termed allelic signatures and used to perform cluster analyses. We termed such an approach High Resolution Virulence Allelic Profiling (HReVAP) and used it to investigate the phylogeny of STEC of multiple serogroups. The dendrograms obtained identified groups of STEC segregating approximately with the serogroups and allowed the identification of subpopulations within the single groups. The study of the allelic signatures provided further evidence of the coevolution of the LEE and OI-122, reflecting the occurrence of their acquisition through a single event. The HReVAP analysis represents a sensitive tool for studying the evolution of LEE-positive STEC. © 2016 Michelacci, Orsini, Knijn, Delannoy, Fach, Caprioli and Morabito.},

abstract={This study aimed to develop a scientific and practical tool to be used to assess horse welfare after commercial transport over long journeys. A set of physical, behavioural and environmental measures was selected, covering welfare aspects of both transport and unloading procedures. The protocol was field-tested on 51 intra-EU commercial transports arriving at different sites in Italy. Univariate analysis was implemented to look for associations between the input variables (environmental hazards potentially affecting the animal well-being during long transports) and the outcome variables (direct evaluation of the animal condition). No severe welfare impairments were recorded (ie dead on arrival, severe injuries, non-ambulatory animals), while milder ones were more frequent at unloading (eg slipping; 36.7%, reluctance to move; 9.6%). Correlations emerged between ramp slope and falling; type of ramp floor and slipping; fast gait and the presence of gaps between the ramp and the floor. The horses' behaviour was also related to the type of handling procedure used. The measures were repeatable and practical to apply and score during real-time unloading. This work provides a sound basis for a new and practical welfare assessment tool for horses travelling over long journeys.

abstract={A rapid, selective and effective method of extraction, clean-up and concentration of organophosphorous pesticides from wheat followed by electrospray (ESI) LC-MS/MS analysis was developed. The μ-SPE (micro-solid-phase extraction) procedure resulted in good analytical performance and reduced at the same time matrix effects, analysis time and solvent consumption. Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were in the range of 0.3–10 and 1–30 μg kg−1, respectively, with good reproducibility (RSD ≤ 13.8) and recoveries between 75% and 109%. Coefficients of determination (r2) were greater than 0.996 for the studied pesticides. Despite the reduced sorbent bed mass of μ-SPE tips (4.2 mg), the analytical data showed that no saturation phenomena occurs in the tested range of concentration both for single compounds and mixtures. Several real samples were analysed and the concentrations of the selected pesticides were found to be below the respective maximum residue limit (MRLs). © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Sheep flocks are sensitive to the top soil intake, via their grazing activity and the ingestion of soil particles incorporated into the hay especially during harvesting operations. Such intake is estimated between 2 and 20% of the dry matter from grass and hay and may vary accounting for seasonal and geographical differences in the quality of pastures. The persistent organic pollutants accumulated in soil such as polychlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and -furans (PCDD/Fs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs), may transfer through the food chain. In this paper, the authors consider the quality of soils and the toxicokinetic factors that allow the transfer of the contamination to milk and the edible tissues in sheep. The wide range of PCDD/F concentration reported in milk (0.05-30 pg WHO1998-TEQ/g fat), meat (0.18-4.9 pg WHO1998-TEQ/g fat) and liver (4.8-161 pg WHO1998-TEQ/g fat) from extensively reared flocks in areas of European countries under different industrial and urban pressures, indicate the opportunity to adopt risk management options based on environmental quality standards and good agriculture practices, able to support the access to a safe and nutritious food. With respect to the PCDD/F and DL-PCB intake, liver represents the most contaminated food item, for its ability to bind such lipophilic contaminants irrespective of its lipid content. Case-studies from the Mediterranean area are illustrated, to support the environment and health approach also in terms of sustainability of family farms production. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Here we realized a networks-based model representing the process of actin remodelling that occurs during the acquisition of fertilizing ability of human spermatozoa (HumanMade-ActinSpermNetwork, HM-ASN). Then, we compared it with the networks provided by two different text mining tools: Agilent Literature Search (ALS) and PESCADOR. As a reference, we used the data from the online repository Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), referred to the actin dynamics in a more general biological context. We found that HM-ALS and the networks from KEGG data shared the same scale-free topology following the Barabasi-Albert model, thus suggesting that the information is spread within the network quickly and efficiently. On the contrary, the networks obtained by ALS and PESCADOR have a scale-free hierarchical architecture, which implies a different pattern of information transmission. Also, the hubs identified within the networks are different: HM-ALS and KEGG networks contain as hubs several molecules known to be involved in actin signalling; ALS was unable to find other hubs than "actin," whereas PESCADOR gave some nonspecific result. This seems to suggest that the human-made information retrieval in the case of a specific event, such as actin dynamics in human spermatozoa, could be a reliable strategy. © 2016 Nicola Bernabò et al.},

abstract={Food-borne campylobacteriosis is caused mainly by the handling or consumption of undercooked chicken meat or by the ingestion of contaminated raw milk. Knowledge about the contributions of different food sources to gastrointestinal disease is fundamental to prioritize food safety interventions and to establish proper control strategies. Assessing the genetic diversity among Campylobacter species is essential to our understanding of their epidemiology and population structure. We molecularly characterized 56 Campylobacter jejuni isolates (31 from patients hospitalized with gastroenteritis, 17 from raw milk samples, and 8 from chicken samples) using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in order to trace the source of the disease. We also used a population genetic approach to investigate the source of the human cases from six different reservoirs of infection. MLST identified 25 different sequence types and 11 clonal complexes (CCs) (21, 658, 206, 353, 443, 48, 61, 257, 1332, 354, 574) and these included several alleles not cited previously in the PubMLST international database. The most prevalent CCs were 21, 206, and 354. PFGE showed 34 pulsotypes divided between 28 different clusters. At the fine scale, by means of PFGE and MLST, only two human cases were linked to raw milk, while one case was linked to chicken meat. The investigation revealed the presence of several genotypes among the human isolates, which probably suggests multiple foci for the infections. Finally, the source attribution model we used revealed that most cases were attributed to chicken (69.75%) as the main reservoir in Italy, followed to a lesser extent by the following sources: Cattle (8.25%); environment (6.28%); wild bird (7.37%); small ruminant (5.35%), and pork (2.98%). This study confirms the importance of correlating epidemiological investigations with molecular epidemiological data to better understand the dynamics of infection. © 2016 Di Giannatale, Garofolo, Alessiani, Di Donato, Candeloro, Vencia, Decastelli and Marotta.},

Four MAbs specific for the E. coli O104:H4 LPS (1E6G6, 1F4C9, 3G6G7, and 4G10D2) were characterized and evaluated for the use in a method for the detection of E. coli O104:H4 in milk samples that involves antibody conjugation to magnetic microbeads to reduce time and increase the efficiency of isolation. MAb 1E6G6 was selected and coupled to microbeads, then used for immuno-magnetic separation (IMS); the efficiency of the IMS method for E. coli O104:H4 isolation from milk was evaluated and compared to that of the EU RL VTEC conventional culture-based isolation procedure. Milk suspensions also containing other pathogenic bacteria that could potentially be found in milk (Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) were also tested to evaluate the specificity of MAb-coated beads. Beads coated with MAb 1E6G6 showed a good ability to capture the E. coli O104:H4, even in milk samples contaminated with other bacteria, with a higher number of E. coli O104:H4 CFU reisolated in comparison with the official method (121 and 41 CFU, respectively, at 103 E. coli O104:H4 initial load; 19 and 6 CFU, respectively, at 102 E. coli O104:H4 initial load; 1 and 0 CFU, respectively, at 101 E. coli O104:H4 initial load).

abstract={In many European shelters, dogs may spend many years confined. A poor environment and inappropriate management may lead to a low quality of life. The absence of harmonised European regulatory frameworks defining the minimum requirements for shelter facilities makes the definition of welfare standards for kennelled dogs challenging. Here, a new protocol was developed and tested to help identify the main welfare issues for shelter dogs. Twenty-six indicators were identified including management, resource and animal based measures. Accuracy and interobserver reliability were checked between four assessors. The protocol was applied in 29 shelters (n=1308 dogs) in six European countries. Overall prevalence of poor health conditions was below 10%. Test-retest reliability and validity of the protocol were investigated with encouraging results. A logistic regression was carried out to assess the potential of the protocol as a tool to identify welfare hazards in shelter environments. Inappropriate space allowance, for example, was found to be a risk factor potentially affecting the animal's cleanliness, skin condition and body condition. The protocol was designed to be concise and easy to implement. Systematic data collection could help identify welfare problems that are likely to arise in certain shelter designs and thus determine improvement in animal care standards.},

abstract={We assessed motor laterality in sheep to explore species-specific brain hemi-field dominance and how this could be affected by genetic or developmental factors. Further, we investigated whether directionality and strength of laterality could be linked to emotional stress in ewes and their lambs during partial separation. Forty-three ewes and their singleton lambs were scored on the (left/right) direction of turn in a y-maze to rejoin a conspecific (laterality test). Further, their behavioural response (i.e. time spent near the fence, vocalisations, and activity level) during forced separation by an open-mesh fence was assessed (separation test). Individual laterality was recorded for 44.2 % ewes (significant right bias) and 81.4 % lambs (equally biased to the left and the right). There was no significant association in side bias between dams and offspring. The Chi-squared test revealed a significant population bias for both groups (p < 0.05). Evolutionary adaptive strategies or stimuli-related visual laterality may provide explanation for this decision-making process. Absolute strength of laterality (irrespective of side) was high (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, dams: D = 0.2; p < 0.001; lambs: D = 0.36, p < 0.0001). The Wilcoxon test showed that lateralised lambs and dams spent significantly more time near each other during separation than non-lateralised animals (p < 0.05), and that lateralised dams were also more active than non-lateralised ones. Arguably, the lateralised animals showed a greater attraction to their pair because they were more disturbed and thus required greater reassurance. The data show that measures of laterality offer a potential novel non-invasive indicator of separation stress. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The heavy metals concentrations did not differ significantly between juveniles and adults neither between males and females. The analysed samples showed a lower Hg concentration than those found elsewhere for this species. Furthermore, for Cr, Cd and Hg levels were not significant correlations between tarsus length and body weight. Contrary Pb was negatively correlated with tarsus length, showing the absence of recent exposure of the birds.},

abstract={Amniotic epithelial cells (AECs) are a class of fetal stem cells that derives from the epiblast and resides in the amnion until birth. AECs are suitable candidates for regenerative medicine because of the ease of collection, their low immunogenicity and inability to form tumors after transplantation. Even though human AECs have been widely investigated, the fact remains that very little is known about AECs isolated from rat, one of the most common animal models in medical testing. In this study, we showed that rat AECs retained stemness properties and plasticity, expressed the pluripotency markers Sox2, Nanog, and Oct4 and were able to differentiate toward the osteogenic lineage. The addition of conditioned medium collected from rat AECs to lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages elicited anti-inflammatory properties through a decrease of Tnfa expression and slowed tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype was also significantly lower upon incubation of senescent human IMR-90 fibroblast cells with conditioned medium from rat AECs. These results confirm the potential of AECs in the modulation of inflammatory mechanisms and open new therapeutic possibilities for regenerative medicine and anti-aging therapies as well.},

abstract={Population management of free-roaming domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) is of interest due to the threat these animals pose to people, other animals and the environment. Current sterilization procedures for male dogs include surgical and chemical methods. However, little is known about how these procedures affect their behavior. The primary objective of this study was to investigate changes in selected behaviors following chemical and surgical sterilization in a male free-roaming dog (FRD) population in southern Chile. We also examined the association between serum testosterone levels and behaviors thought to be influenced by circulating androgens. A total of 174 dogs were randomly assigned to either a surgical or chemical sterilization group, or a control group. At the onset of the intervention period, 119 dogs remained and 102 dogs successfully completed the study. Each dog was monitored pre- and post-intervention using video recordings, GPS collars, and blood samples for the measurement of testosterone. Analysis of behavior revealed that surgically castrated dogs showed no reduction of sexual activity or aggression when compared to their pre-intervention behavior. Chemically sterilized dogs showed a statistically significant increase in dog-directed aggression, but no change in sexual activity. There was no change in home range size in any groups between the pre- and post-intervention measurement. We found no consistent association between levels of serum testosterone concentration and behavioral changes in any of the groups. This study presents the first detailed behavioral observations following surgical and chemical sterilization in male FRDs. The information generated is highly relevant to communities struggling with the control of FRDs. Complementary studies to further our understanding of the effects of male sterilization on the behavioral and reproductive dynamics of FRD populations are needed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A 7-year-old Dachshund was clinically examined because of a 10-day history of lameness in the left hind limb. On the basis of radiological and cytological findings, an osteosarcoma of the left acetabular region was suspected. The dog underwent a hemipelvectomy and osteosarcoma was diagnosed by subsequent histopathological examination. An immovable subcutaneous mass was noted on the left chest wall during the physical examination and non-septic neutrophilic inflammation was diagnosed by cytology. Forty days later, the dog showed signs of respiratory distress with an in-diameter increase of the subcutaneous mass up to 4cm. Thoracic radiography and ultrasonography revealed pleural effusion and a lytic process in the fourth left rib. Furthermore, ultrasound examination revealed a mixed echogenic mobile structure with a diameter of around 2cm floating within the pleural fluid of the left hemithorax close to the pericardium. The dog underwent surgery for an en bloc resection of the subcutaneous mass together with the fourth rib and the parietal pleura. Moreover, the left altered lung lobe, corresponding to the mobile structure detected by ultrasound, was removed. Based on cytological, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examinations, an invasive epithelioid pleural malignant mesothelioma was diagnosed. © 2015 Di Tommaso et al.},

abstract={We report the spread of a clone of multidrug-resistant (MDR), ESBL-producing (blaCTX-M-1) Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Infantis, in the Italian broiler chicken industry and along the food-chain. This was first detected in Italy in 2011 and led to human infection in Italy in 2013-2014.A set (n = 49) of extended-spectrum cephalosporin (ESC)-resistant (R) isolates of S. Infantis (2011-2014) from humans, food-producing animals and meat thereof, were studied along with a selected set of earlier and more recent ESC-susceptible (ESC-S) isolates (n = 42, 2001-2014). They were characterized by macrorestriction-PFGE analysis and genetic environment of ESC-resistance. Isolates representative of PFGE-patterns and origin were submitted to Whole Genome Sequencing. The emerging ESC-R clone, detected mainly from broiler chickens, broiler meat and humans, showed a minimum pattern of clinical resistance to cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulfonamides, and trimethoprim, beside ciprofloxacin microbiological resistance (MIC 0.25 mg/L). All isolates of this clone harbored a conjugative megaplasmid (~ 280-320 Kb), similar to that described in ESC-susceptible S. Infantis in Israel (pESI-like) in 2014. This megaplasmid carried the ESBL gene blaCTX-M-1, and additional genes [tet(A), sul1, dfrA1 and dfrA14] mediating cefotaxime, tetracycline, sulfonamide, and trimethoprim resistance. It also contained genes conferring enhanced colonization capability, virulence (fimbriae, yersiniabactin), resistance and fitness (qacE1, mer) in the intensive-farming environment. This emerging clone of S. Infantis has been causing infections in humans, most likely through the broiler industry. Since S. Infantis is among major serovars causing human infections in Europe and is an emerging non-typhoidal Salmonella globally, further spread of this lineage in primary productions deserves quick and thorough risk-management strategies. © 2015 Franco et al. 2015 Franco et al.

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-transmitted Flavivirus belonging to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the Flaviviridae family. Its spread in the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans poses a significant risk to human health and forces public health officials to constantly monitor the virus transmission to ensure prompt application of preventive measures. In this context, predictive tools indicating the areas and periods at major risk of WNV transmission are of paramount importance. Spatial analysis approaches, which use environmental and climatic variables to find suitable habitats for WNV spread, can enhance predictive techniques. Using the Mahalanobis Distance statistic, areas ecologically most suitable for sustaining WNV transmission were identified in the Mediterranean basin and Central Europe. About 270 human and equine clinical cases notified in Italy, Greece, Portugal, Morocco, and Tunisia, between 2008 and 2012, have been considered. The environmental variables included in the model were altitude, slope, nighttime Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, and daily temperature range. Seasonality of mosquito population has been modelled and included in the analyses to produce monthly maps of suitable areas for West Nile Disease. Between May and July, the most suitable areas are located in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and North Cyprus. Summer/Autumn months, particularly between August and October, characterize the suitability in Italy, France, Spain, the Balkan countries, Morocco, North Tunisia, the Mediterranean coast of Africa, and the Middle East. The persistence of suitable conditions in December is confined to the coastal areas of Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Israel. © 2015 Conte et al.

abstract={Viruses have often evolved overlapping reading frames in order to maximize their coding capacity. Until recently, the segmented dsRNA genome of viruses of the Orbivirus genus was thought to be monocistronic, but the identification of the bluetongue virus (BTV) NS4 protein changed this assumption. A small ORF in segment 10, overlapping the NS3 ORF in the +1 position, is maintained in more than 300 strains of the 27 different BTV serotypes and in more than 200 strains of the phylogenetically related African horse sickness virus (AHSV). In BTV, this ORF (named S10-ORF2 in this study) encodes a putative protein 50–59 residues in length and appears to be under strong positive selection. HA- or GFP-tagged versions of S10-ORF2 expressed from transfected plasmids localized within the nucleoli of transfected cells, unless a putative nucleolar localization signal was mutated. S10-ORF2 inhibited gene expression, but not RNA translation, in transient transfection reporter assays. In both mammalian and insect cells, BTV S10-ORF2 deletion mutants (BTV8DS10-ORF2) displayed similar replication kinetics to wt virus. In vivo, S10-ORF2 deletion mutants were pathogenic in mouse models of disease. Although further evidence is required for S10-ORF2 expression during infection, the data presented provide an initial characterization of this ORF. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis which affects humans and a wide range of domestic and wild ruminants. The large spread of RVF in Africa and its potential to emerge beyond its geographic range requires the development of surveillance strategies to promptly detect the disease outbreaks in order to implement efficient control measures, which could prevent the widespread of the virus to humans. The Animal Health Mediterranean Network (REMESA) linking some Northern African countries as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia with Southern European ones as France, Italy, Portugal and Spain aims at improving the animal health in the Western Mediterranean Region since 2009. In this context, a first assessment of the diagnostic capacities of the laboratories involved in the RVF surveillance was performed. The first proficiency testing (external quality assessment- EQA) for the detection of the viral genome and antibodies of RVF virus (RVFV) was carried out from October 2013 to February 2014. Ten laboratories participated from 6 different countries (4 from North Africa and 2 from Europe). Six laboratories participated in the ring trial for both viral RNA and antibodies detection methods, while four laboratories participated exclusively in the antibodies detection ring trial. For the EQA targeting the viral RNA detection methods 5 out of 6 laboratories reported 100% of correct results. One laboratory misidentified 2 positive samples as negative and 3 positive samples as doubtful indicating a need for corrective actions. For the EQA targeting IgG and IgM antibodies methods 9 out of the 10 laboratories reported 100% of correct results, whilst one laboratory reported all correct results except one false-positive. These two ring trials provide evidence that most of the participating laboratories are capable to detect RVF antibodies and viral RNA thus recognizing RVF infection in affected ruminants with the diagnostic methods currently available. © 2015 Monaco et al.

abstract={Understanding the demographic history and genetic make-up of colonizing species is critical for inferring population sources and colonization routes. This is of main interest for designing accurate control measures in areas newly colonized by vector species of economically important pathogens. The biting midge Culicoides imicola is a major vector of orbiviruses to livestock. Historically, the distribution of this species was limited to the Afrotropical region. Entomological surveys first revealed the presence of C. imicola in the south of the Mediterranean basin by the 1970s. Following recurrent reports of massive bluetongue outbreaks since the 1990s, the presence of the species was confirmed in northern areas. In this study, we addressed the chronology and processes of C. imicola colonization in the Mediterranean basin. We characterized the genetic structure of its populations across Mediterranean and African regions using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers, and combined phylogeographical analyses with population genetics and approximate Bayesian computation. We found a west/east genetic differentiation between populations, occurring both within Africa and within the Mediterranean basin. We demonstrated that three of these groups had experienced demographic expansions in the Pleistocene, probably because of climate changes during this period. Finally, we showed that C. imicola could have colonized the Mediterranean basin in the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene through a single event of introduction; however, we cannot exclude the hypothesis involving two routes of colonization. Thus, the recent bluetongue outbreaks are not linked to C. imicola colonization event, but rather to biological changes in the vector or the virus. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is a recently re-emerged health problem in Europe. In Italy, an increasing number of outbreaks of West Nile disease, with occurrences of human cases, have been reported since 2008. This is particularly true in northern Italy, where entomological surveillance systems have been implemented at a regional level. The aim of this study was to use, for the first time, all the entomological data collected in the five regions undergoing surveillance for WNV in northern Italy to characterize the viral circulation (at a spatial and temporal scale), identify potential mosquito vectors, and specify relationships between virus circulation and meteorological conditions. In 2013, 286 sites covering the entire Pianura Padana area were monitored. A total of 757,461 mosquitoes were sampled. Of these, 562,079 were tested by real-time PCR in 9,268 pools, of which 180 (1.9%) were positive for WNV. The largest part of the detected WNV sequences belonged to lineage II, demonstrating that, unlike those in the past, the 2013 outbreak was mainly sustained by this WNV lineage. This surveillance also detected the Usutu virus, a WNV-related flavivirus, in 241 (2.6%) pools. The WNV surveillance systems precisely identified the area affected by the virus and detected the viral circulation approximately two weeks before the occurrence of onset of human cases. Ninety percent of the sampled mosquitoes were Culex pipiens, and 178/180 WNV-positive pools were composed of only this species, suggesting this mosquito is the main WNV vector in northern Italy. A significantly higher abundance of the vector was recorded in the WNV circulation area, which was characterized by warmer and less rainy conditions and greater evapotranspiration compared to the rest of the Pianura Padana, suggesting that areas exposed to these conditions are more suitable for WNV circulation. This observation highlights warmer and less rainy conditions as factors able to enhance WNV circulation and cause virus spillover outside the sylvatic cycle. Copyright: © 2015 Calzolari et al.

abstract={Abstract Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is a Flavivirus transmitted to vertebrate hosts by mosquitoes, maintained in nature through an enzootic bird-mosquito cycle. In Europe the virus became of major public health and veterinary concern in the 1990s. In Italy, WNV re-emerged in 2008, ten years after the previous outbreak and is currently endemic in many areas of the country. In particular, the northeastern part of Italy experience continuous viral circulation, with human outbreaks caused by different genovariants of WNV lineage 1, Western-European and Mediterranean subcluster, and WNV lineage 2, Hungarian clade. Alongside the WNV National Surveillance Program that has been in place since 2002, regional surveillance plans were implemented after 2008 targeting mosquitoes, animals and humans. Findings: In July and September 2014, West Nile virus lineage 2 was detected in pools of Culex pipiens s.l. mosquitoes from northeastern Italy. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of two representative samples identified the presence of WNV lineage 2 related to the Volgograd 2007 strain (99.3 % nucleotide sequence identity), in addition to WNV lineage 2 Hungarian clade. Conclusions: This is the first evidence of the circulation of a WNV lineage 2 strain closely related to the Volgograd 2007 outside Eastern Europe, where it has caused large human outbreaks. This strain may pose a new threat to animal and human health in Italy. © 2015 Ravagnan et al.},

abstract={The Italian Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park represents one of the largest protected areas in Europe, and it is particularly suitable for the preservation of the wild fauna including some endangered species, such as Abruzzi chamois, Apennine wolf and Marsicano brown bear. Wild boar population residing within the National Park Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga has been sharply increasing and negatively impacts on sensitive ecosystems and human activities. Thus, a management plan, based on wild boar capture by means of catch fences and slaughter, has been implemented. About the 77% of wild boars under study were "young adult" (aged 4-12 months, body weight = 20-60 kg), and the remaining 23% were adult (aged > 12 months). At slaughterhouse, pathological findings have been recorded from 101 wild boars. Microscopic investigations have been carried out on diseased, as well as on apparently healthy tissues. Blood samples collected from 126 wild boars were tested for Aujeszky's disease virus, Brucella suis and Leptospira interrogans. Lesions were mainly caused by parasites, and parasitic bronchopneumonia by Metastrongylus spp. was most frequently observed (92%). Hepatic white spots (28%), lymphoproliferative nodules, hepatic distomatosis (3%), Cysticercus tenuicollis (15%) and hydatid cysts (6%) were also commonly detected. Serology demonstrated a high prevalence of Aujeszky's disease (35%) and Brucella suis (15%) antibodies in the population under study. Zoonoses represent about the 60% of emerging public health concerns, and the majority of emerging infectious diseases arise from wild animals. In that context, wild boar is of particular relevance because of its extreme adaptability in different habitats, its wide geographical distribution and its high reproductive rates. The implementation of this management plan represented a good chance to face the wild fauna living within the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. Pathological findings herein described, along with concurrent microbiological, serological and parasitological investigations, contribute to evaluate the health status of wild boar population residing in such a relevant protected area.},

abstract={Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an arthropod-transmitted viral disease of certain wild ungulates, notably North American white-tailed deer and, more rarely, cattle. The disease in white-tailed deer results from vascular injury analogous to that caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), to which EHD virus (EHDV) is closely related. There are seven serotypes of EHDV recognised, and Ibaraki virus, which is the cause of sporadic disease outbreaks in cattle in Asia, is included in EHDV serotype 2. The global distribution and epidemiology of BTV and EHDV infections are also similar, as both viruses occur throughout temperate and tropical regions of the world where they are transmitted by biting Culicoides midges and infect a wide variety of domestic and wild ungulates. However, the global distribution and epidemiology of EHDV infection are less well characterised than they are for BTV. Whereas most natural and experimental EHDV infections (other than Ibaraki virus infection) of livestock are subclinical or asymptomatic, outbreaks of EHD have recently been reported among cattle in the Mediterranean Basin, Reunion Island, South Africa, and the United States. Accurate and convenient laboratory tests are increasingly available for the sensitive and specific serological and virological diagnosis of EHDV infection and confirmation of EHD in animals, but commercial vaccines are available only for prevention of Ibaraki disease and not for protection against other strains and serotypes of EHDV.},

abstract={The Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) is a geographically isolated subspecies of chamois currently living only in limited areas of Central Italy. It is included in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). To assure long-term conservation of the species, the number of individuals needs to be increased creating a consistent and viable population. Accordingly, relocation for reintroduction programs is being planned. However, this could lead to the introduction of infectious diseases. Thus, knowledge on the health status of the Apennine chamois is important for the management of this species. In the absence of existing data, retrospective investigation is useful. A serological retrospective survey on 119 Apennine chamois, captured for routine marking or reintroduction operations from 1990 to 2008 at the National Park of Abruzzo, Lazio, and Molise (PNALM), was performed to detect antibodies against pestiviruses, bovine parainfluenza 3 virus (PI-3), bluetongue virus (BTV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), Brucella spp., Chlamydophila spp., Coxiella burnetti, and Leptospira spp. Serums were negative for PI-3, BTV, BHV-1, Brucella spp., Chlamydophila spp., C. burnetti, and Leptospira spp., while three animals in 1992 and five in 2008 were positive for pestivirus antibodies. Although the number of samples per year was often limited, inference to evaluate the infectious status of the overall population in the PNALM was attempted. Better planning of sampling activities and a specific surveillance program for infectious diseases are needed, especially in a small and limited population like the Apennine chamois, in which reintroduction programs are considered strategic for conservation and risk factors, like sharing of grazing with wild and domestic animals, exist. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1 ) and ochratoxin A (OTA) in different traditional meat products circulating on Croatian markets, produced by a large number of households situated in different Croatian regions. The study involved a total of 410 samples of traditional pork meat products in terms of hams (n=105), dry fermented sausages (n=208), bacon (n=62) and cooked sausages (n=35), collected over four years period (2011-2014). Mycotoxin concentrations were quantified and confirmed using validated immunoassay method (ELISA) and high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD), respectively. The maximal observed OTA level in the fermented sausages and hams was around 5 times (5.10μg/kg) to 10 times (9.95μg/kg) higher than the maximal recommended level (1μg/kg) stipulated for pork products in some EU countries. AFB 1 levels found in any given meat product analysed within this frame were not significantly higher (p&gt;0.05) than the applied method limit of detection. The results showed an occasional mycotoxin contamination of traditional meat products, especially that by OTA, pointing that to avoid such contamination meat and meat products on households should be produced and processed under standardised and well-controlled conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Palytoxin (PlTX) induces a stress response in MCF-7 cells that involves the phosphorylation of HSP 27 at serines 15, 78, and 82 by an as yet undetermined mechanism. We have studied the involvement of major groups of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family in this molecular response and focused our analyses on the ERK1/2, JNK, p38 protein kinase (p38K), and ERK5 pathways. The results show that PlTX induces the activation of JNK and p38 kinase but not ERK1/2 and 5 in MCF-7 cells. Through the use of protein kinase inhibitors, we established that blocking p38K, but not JNK, prevents the phosphorylation of HSP 27 induced by PlTX and that MAPKAPK2 participates in the response induced by the toxin under our experimental conditions. The cell death response induced by PlTX was inhibited by preventing JNK phosphorylation but not by blocking p38K/MAPKAPK2 and HSP 27 phosphorylation. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation revealed that MCF-7 cell extracts contain a heterodisperse population of HSP 27, including oligomers and smaller forms. Treating MCF-7 cells with PlTX caused the dissociation of HSP 27 oligomers, and using inhibitors of the JNK and p38K pathways showed that the dissociation of HSP 27 oligomers induced by PlTX involves a p38K-dependent process. We conclude that the changes induced by PlTX in the HSP 27 stress response protein system proceed through a molecular mechanism involving the activation of the p38 kinase pathway and its substrate, MAPKAK2, leading to dissociation of HSP 27 oligomers and the stabilization of a cellular pool of monomers phosphorylated at serines 15, 78 and 82, which could play a protective role against the death response induced by PlTX. © 2015 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Introduction - African swine fever (ASF) is regarded as the most serious health threat to the global pig industry and is caused by a complex linear double-stranded DNA virus (ASF virus, ASFV), currently classified as the only member of the family Asfarviridae. Aim- To describe an outbreak of ASF, which occurred in Namibia and was managed during international co-operation therein carried out by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e Molise "G. Caporale" (Teramo, Italy). Materials and methods - The ASF outbreak occurred in the district of Omaruru (Namibia) and affected a small swine herd consisting of about 100 pigs. The herd was part of a hunting farm and was very close to a small abattoir, where warthogs had been recently slaughtered. Clinical signs suddenly onset and affected pigs of different classes of age. Two pigs were necropsied for diagnostic purpose: histopathology, direct immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction. Results - At necropsy, all pigs under investigation showed generalized hemorrhagic lesions. Microscopically, recently occurred hemorrhages were mainly observed, along with a severe lymphocytolysis in all lymphoid tissues. Laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis of ASF. The outbreak was finally solved by stamping out. Discussion - In Africa, ASFV infection strictly depends upon the "sylvatic cycle", which involves warthogs and ticks of the Ornithodoros moubata complex. The mechanisms of transmission from wildlife and domestic pigs are still unclear, but ticks most likely play a key role. Therefore, the ASF outbreak described herein could represent the prototype of ASF in southern Africa. In that region, ASFV eradication seems not achievable and ASF control should focus on biosecurity measures. As in the present report, acute ASF usually occurs with very high morbidity and mortality, at least in previously unexposed pigs. On the contrary, sub-clinical and chronic infections are more frequent in endemic areas. Pathological findings are extremely useful to diagnose and counteract ASF. A number of hemorrhagic diseases should be considered in differential diagnoses. Anamnestic and epidemiological data prove to be helpful to correctly address the diagnostic process. Conclusions - The recent outbreak in Eastern Europe further confirms that ASF that is a serious transboundary disease, which still negatively impacts the pig industry worldwide. Epidemiological and pathological features described herein are of diagnostic value and of relevance to promptly counteract the spreading and the economic impact of the disease.},

abstract={The transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders characterised by the accumulation of a pathological form of a host protein known as prion protein (PrP). The validation of abnormal PrP detection techniques is fundamental to allow the use of high-throughput laboratory based tests, avoiding the limitations of bioassays.We used scrapie, a prototype TSE, to examine the relationship between infectivity and laboratory based diagnostic tools. The data may help to optimise strategies to prevent exposure of humans to small ruminant TSE material via the food chain. Abnormal PrP distribution/accumulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), Western blot (WB) and ELISA in samples from four animals. In addition, infectivity was detected using a sensitive bank vole bioassay with selected samples from two of the four sheep and protein misfolding cyclic amplification using bank vole brain as substrate (vPMCA) was also carried out in selected samples from one animal. Lymph nodes, oculomotor muscles, sciatic nerve and kidney were positive by IHC, WB and ELISA, although at levels 100-1000 fold lower than the brain, and contained detectable infectivity by bioassay. Tissues not infectious by bioassay were also negative by all laboratory tests including PMCA. Although discrepancies were observed in tissues with very low levels of abnormal PrP, there was an overall good correlation between IHC, WB, ELISA and bioassay results. Most importantly, there was a good correlation between the detection of abnormal PrP in tissues using laboratory tests and the levels of infectivity even when the titre was low. These findings provide useful information for risk modellers and represent a first step toward the validation of laboratory tests used to quantify prion infectivity, which would greatly aid TSE risk assessment policies. © 2015 Chianini et al.},

abstract={In 2009, a novel swine-origin H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) influenza A virus (IAV) reached pandemic status and was soon after detected in pigs worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether differences in the HA protein can affect pathogenicity and antigenicity of H1N1pdm09 in swine. We compared lung pathology, viral replication and shedding and the antigenic relationships of four wild-type H1N1pdm09 viruses in pigs: one human (CA/09) and three isolated in swine after the pandemic (IL/09, IL/10, and MN/10). The swine strains were selected based upon unique amino acid substitutions in the HA protein. All selected viruses resulted in mild disease and viral shedding through nasal and oral fluids, however, viral replication and the degree of pathology varied between the isolates. A/Swine/IL/5265/2010 (IL/10), with substitutions I120M, S146G, S186P, V252M, had lower viral titers in the lungs and nasal secretions and fewer lung lesions. The other two swine viruses caused respiratory pathology and replicated to titers similar to the human CA/09, although MN/10 (with mutations D45Y, K304E, A425S) had lower nasal shedding. Swine-adapted H1N1pdm09 have zoonotic potential, and have reassorted with other co-circulating swine viruses, influencing the evolution of IAV in swine globally. Further, our results suggest that amino acid changes in the HA gene have the potential to alter the virulence of H1N1pdm09 in swine. Importantly, the limited clinical signs in pigs could result in continued circulation of these viruses with other endemic swine IAVs providing opportunities for reassortment. © 2015 .},

abstract={Understanding how epidemics spread in a system is a crucial step to prevent and control outbreaks, with broad implications on the system’s functioning, health, and associated costs. This can be achieved by identifying the elements at higher risk of infection and implementing targeted surveillance and control measures. One important ingredient to consider is the pattern of disease-transmission contacts among the elements, however lack of data or delays in providing updated records may hinder its use, especially for time-varying patterns. Here we explore to what extent it is possible to use past temporal data of a system’s pattern of contacts to predict the risk of infection of its elements during an emerging outbreak, in absence of updated data. We focus on two real-world temporal systems; a livestock displacements trade network among animal holdings, and a network of sexual encounters in high-end prostitution. We define the node’s loyalty as a local measure of its tendency to maintain contacts with the same elements over time, and uncover important non-trivial correlations with the node’s epidemic risk. We show that a risk assessment analysis incorporating this knowledge and based on past structural and temporal pattern properties provides accurate predictions for both systems. Its generalizability is tested by introducing a theoretical model for generating synthetic temporal networks. High accuracy of our predictions is recovered across different settings, while the amount of possible predictions is system-specific. The proposed method can provide crucial information for the setup of targeted intervention strategies. © 2015 Valdano et al.},

abstract={A telephone survey was carried out on 13,486 randomly selected households located in the Abruzzo region (central Italy). Three questionnaires were specifically designed in relation to three different groups of foods (Meat and meat products, Fishery products, Fruit and vegetables). Questions were mainly focused on the amount and number of purchases, type of retailer, and home food handling practices with respect to the week prior to the interview. Data were classified according to a multilingual thesaurus system (LanguaL). Results allowed to estimate domestic purchases (in kg) per capita for different food categories. The category ". Red meat/. Cattle" accounted for a large part of purchases in the "meat and meat products" group (10.9kg per capita/year; 32.2% of purchases in the group) while the category ". Fish or related organism/. Fish" was the most purchased in the "fishery products" group (6.9kg per capita/year; 63.3%). The aggregation of more detailed characteristics enabled the identification of popular categories of foods, such as ". Red meat/. Cattle/. Divided into pieces" (25% of the "meat and meat products" group). Significant differences (. p<0.05) were found between the four different provinces (L'Aquila, Chieti, Pescara and Teramo) with respect to ". Poultry/. Chicken" and ". Red meat/. Cattle" categories. Householders were also asked about post-purchase food handling practices that might be hazardous to food safety. More than 20% of those surveyed stated that they thawed frozen meat at room temperature. The degree of doneness after cooking of different food categories was generally high: over 90% of products purchased in the majority of meat and fish categories were properly cooked. However a noticeable proportion of householders (about 15%) reported medium or rare cooking of ". Red meat/. Cattle" and ". Red meat/. Swine". Differences (. p<0.05) were also found between consumers of different ages, with people over 65 years old being more prone to freeze meat and cook it thoroughly.The survey was carried out in a specific geographic area and on a statistically significant sample of households, thus allowing a collection of data on domestic habits relating to food purchases and home food handling practices. This information should be included in the framework of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) models as a measure of the actual exposure of consumers to pathogenic microorganism. The LanguaL system also proved to be a practical language-independent method useful not only to identify and describe food items but also to classify them according to specific food safety characteristics. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The present study evaluated the occurrence of zoonotic parasites in feces and on fur of stray and private dogs living in Italy. Individual fecal samples collected from 117 and 385 kenneled (i.e., rescue shelter) and privately owned dogs, respectively, were examined by conventional copromicroscopy. Samples positive for Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. were subjected to further genetic characterization. Additionally, 174 fur samples of private and kenneled dogs living in the same area, 27 of which were also subjected to copromicroscopical examinations, were examined for the presence and viability of parasite elements. Out of 502 fecal samples, forty-one (8.2 %) scored positive for G. duodenalis cysts while one (0.2 %) for Cryptosporidium oocysts. Nine private dogs were molecularly positive for G. duodenalis assemblage C (n. 7), assemblage D (n. 1), and assemblages C + D (n. 1), while 11 kenneled dogs were positive for assemblage C (n. 8), assemblage D (n. 1), and assemblages C + D (n. 2). Cryptosporidium spp. were identified as C. canis in a private dog. One hundred and seventy-two dogs (34.3 %), i.e., 92 private and 80 kenneled, were positive for zoonotic nematodes: Toxocara canis (6.6 %), Ancylostoma caninum (6.8 %), and Capillaria aerophila (0.6 %). Unviable eggs of Toxocara spp. were found on the hair of five (2.9 %) private dogs. The present findings indicate that canine feces from both private and kenneled animals may contain zoonotic parasites and may be a potential risk for humans and other animals, especially when they contaminate the environment. The role of dog fur as source of human infections should be further investigated. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to shed light in to the complexity of the ovine colostrum proteome, with a specific focus on the low abundance proteins. The ovine colostrum is characterized by a few dominating proteins, as the immunoglobulins, but it also contains less represented protein species, equally important for the correct development of neonates. Ovine colostrum, collected immediately after lambing, was separated by 1D SDS-PAGE. Proteins bands were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. On the basis of the Swiss-Prot database, a total of 343 unique proteins were identified.

abstract={Troglostrongylus brevior and Troglostrongylus subcrenatus, two lungworms thought to infest wild felids, have been found recently in domestic cats from Spain and Italy. These unexpected findings have raised doubts about the assumed past and present occurrence of Troglostrongylus spp., especially T. brevior, in domestic hosts and suggest that there may have been missed detection or misdiagnosis. The present retrospective study evaluated the presence of lungworms in cats from Italy with a diagnosis of respiratory parasitism or with compatible lung lesions from 2002 to 2013. Sixty-eight samples of DNA and larvae from cats with a diagnosis of aelurostrongylosis, and 53 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung samples from cats confirmed as lungworm infested or with compatible lesions, were investigated using two DNA-based assays specific for A. abstrusus or T. brevior. All DNA and larval samples were positive for A. abstrusus and one was additionally positive for T. brevior. Most paraffin-embedded lung tissues were positive only for A. abstrusus, but two samples tested positive for both lungworms and one for T. brevior only. This study supports the major role of A. abstrusus in causing feline respiratory parasitism in endemic areas of Italy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This study aimed to analyse the diversity of the Campylobacter jejuni population in broilers and to evaluate the major source of contamination in poultry meat. Eight rearing cycles over one year provided samples from three different broiler farms processed at the same slaughterhouse. A total of 707 C. jejuni were isolated from cloacal swabs before slaughter and from the breast skin of carcasses after slaughter and after chilling. All suspected Campylobacter colonies were identified with PCR assays and C. jejuni was genotyped by sequence analysis of the flaA short variable region (SVR) and by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using SmaI enzyme. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance profiles were also assayed using minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). The flocks carried many major C. jejuni clones possibly carrying over the rearing cycles, but cross contamination between farms may happen. Many isolates were resistant to fluoroquinolones, raising an issue of high public concern. Specific Campylobacter populations could be harboured within each poultry farm, with the ability to contaminate chickens during each new cycle. Thus, although biosecurity measures are applied, with a persistent source of contamination, they cannot be efficient. The role of the environment needs further investigation to better address strategies to control Campylobacter. © 2015 Francesca Marotta et al.},

abstract={Subtyping of Listeria monocytogenes strains is an essential epidemiological tool to trace contamination and determine evolutionary relationships among different strains. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is the current gold standard method for Listeria characterization. Multiple-Locus Variable-number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA) is a rapid subtyping method based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification that has been successfully developed for subtyping bacterial genera. The purpose of this study was to evaluate MLVA for subtyping L. monocytogenes strains isolated from Italian cheese and to compare it with PFGE. The type ability and discriminatory power of MLVA was determined on a collection of 90 isolates corresponding to 5 serotypes and 29 pulsotypes with enzymes AscI and ApaI. A panel of 5 variable-number tandem repeat loci was used. MLVA and PFGE showed very similar discriminatory power (Simpson’s Index of diversity 0.840 with 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.780/0.899 and 0.837 with 95% CI 0.768/0.906, respectively). MLVA is an easy test to perform. It is relatively fast, reproducible and could be implemented in any molecular laboratory but, according to the performed protocol, it is not sufficient for discriminating the L. monocytogenes strains isolated from cheese. This method could be combined with PFGE to increase the discrimination in molecular subtyping of these strains. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={The genetic diversity of Brucella melitensis and Brucella abortus strains isolated in 199 cattle and sheep from 156 brucellosis outbreaks which occurred in 8 regions of Southern Italy in 2011, was determined using a Multiple-Locus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats Analysis (MLVA‑16) approach. The existence of possible genetic clusters was verified through a hierarchical cluster analysis based on ‘single link’, which is closely related to the minimum spanning tree. The Hamming weighted distance matrix was adopted in the analysis. All calculations were performed using R and the additional libraries phangorn and Cluster. For a number of clusters, ranging from 2 to 15, the average silhouette width was calculated. The number of clusters adopted was identified according to the maximum average silhouette width. For B. abortus and B. melitensis, 6 and 11 genetic clusters were identified, respectively. Three out of 6 B. abortus clusters included the 96.7% of all B. abortus isolates. Clusters were clearly geographically separated, and this highlighted the known epidemiological links among them. Brucella melitensis genotypes resulted more heterogeneous; the 3 more representative genetic clusters included 79.7% of all B. melitensis isolates. A clear geographical clusterization of genotypes is recognizable only for 1 cluster, whereas the others are more widespread across Southern Italy. The genetic characterization of Brucella strains isolated from animals may be a useful tool to better understand the epidemiology and dissemination patterns of this pathogen through host populations. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={The maintenance of tick-borne disease agents in the environment strictly depends on the relationship between tick vectors and their hosts, which act as reservoirs for these pathogens. A pilot study aimed to investigate wild rodents as reservoirs for zoonotic tick-borne pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum) was carried out in an area of Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park (Abruzzi Region, central Italy), a wide protected area where, despite sporadic reports of infection in humans and animals, eco-epidemiological data on these diseases are still not available. Rodents were trapped and released at the capture site after the collection of feeding ticks and blood samples. In all, 172 ticks were collected; the most frequent species was Ixodes acuminatus (53%). Out of 88 tick pools, 11 resulted positive for C. burnetii and 13 for B. burgdorferi s.l.; the Borrelia afzelii genospecies was identified in one Ixodes ricinus tick collected from one Apodemus sp. rodent. Out of 143 blood samples, seven Apodemus spp. and five Myodes glareolus were positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. and two Apodemus spp. were positive for C. burnetii. All samples (ticks and blood) were negative for F. tularensis and A. phagocytophilum. This is the first report of B. burgdorferi s.l. in the environment for Abruzzi Region. Data on the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. are similar to that observed in other Mediterranean countries. The present work is also the first report of C. burnetii in wild rodents in Italy. C. burnetii infection has been largely investigated in Italy in ruminant farms by serology and molecular methods, but information on ecology and on the wild cycle are still lacking. Further studies including genotyping should be performed and species-specific differences between wild rodent reservoirs of Q fever and Lyme disease agents should be investigated. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

abstract={In 2012, serotypes 1 and 4 of bluetongue virus (BTV) entered and co-circulated in Sardinia. The following year, BTV-1 spread all over Sardinia and invaded Sicily and the Italian Tyrrenian coast. In 2014, this strain spread extensively in mainland Italy, causing severe outbreaks. In late 2014, BTV-4 was detected in Southern Italy (Apulia region). This study reports the detection of BTV in species of Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) collected in Italy during the epidemics between 2012 and 2014. A total of 2,925 pools (83,102 midges), sorted from 651 collections made on 339 affected farms of 12 Italian regions, were tested for the presence of BTV by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The study clearly shows that Culicoides imicola and Obsoletus complex have played a crucial role in the bluetongue (BT) epidemics in Italy in 2012-2014. Nevertheless, it also shows that other species may have played a role in transmitting BTV during these outbreaks. Culicoides dewulfi and at least 3 species of the Pulicaris complex, namely Culicoides pulicaris, Culicoides newsteadi and Culicoides punctatus, were found positive to BTV. Serotype 1 was detected in all species tested, whereas the BTV-4 was detected in the Obsoletus complex, C. imicola, and C. newsteadi. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

Non-parametric analysis used single behavioural variables and fear scores to evaluate the effect of parity, sex of lambs, and the association between mother-lamb behaviour. Amongst ewes, Dorset were characterised by a more calm temperament while Sarda (especially primiparous ewes) were more active in their response to challenge (i.e. more attempts to escape). As with their dams, lambs reflected to a certain extent this divergence and overall during isolation lamb fear score was on average significantly higher than dams. Correlations between measures of behavioural reactivity across tests were carried out to search for predictive measures of fear. A very strong correlation emerged linking vocalisation to locomotor activity. Vocalisation could be a good candidate as predictor factor of an active reaction of sheep to a fearful situation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) have emerged as human pathogens and contamination via animal origin has been a major public health concern. We compared the distribution of phylogenetic groups and prevalence of stx gene variants among the pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from feces of diarrheatic calves in Tehran suburb farms. In this study we screened 140 diarrheatic calves (1-15 days old) for E. coli strains during a 3 months period of time. The isolated strains were grouped into different phylotypes according to the presence of chuA, yjaA and TSPE4.C2 genes. Then, the prevalence of stx gene subtypes was evaluated in the B1 phylotypes. From diarrheatic calves, 51 bacterial isolates were biochemically identified as E. coli and 31 isolates out of 51 were considered B1 phylotype using DNA Microarray technology. Of these isolates, 20 contained stx1a and stx1b and one harbored all mentioned variants of stx genes except stx2b2. This study showed that in Tehran suburb, the B1 phylotype of E. coli is prevalent as a causative agent of diarrhea in calves and the prevalence of stx1 gene subtypes is dominant in comparison with other subtypes. Considering the possibility that these stx genes can be spread to other strains, bovine E. coli strains are an important source of stx genes for other strains and further study and surveillance seems to be required for the exact identification of virulence profile of E. coli phylotypes in different hosts. © 2015, Tehran University of Medical Science.

abstract={In Italy, standards for the management of free-roaming dogs (FRDs) are defined by regional norms, generating a high variability of approaches around the country. Despite efforts carried out by the competent authorities, FRDs are still a reality impacting upon animal health and welfare and public costs. A similar scenario can be found in many other Mediterranean and Balkan counties. Here we present 14 years of data (2000–2013) retrieved from the admission dog registry of a public shelter (PS) responsible for the collection of stray dogs from one Italian province. The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the local FRD population, identifying its source and to evaluate the effectiveness of the actions implemented by the local authorities. In the investigated period, 7,475 dogs were admitted to the PS. Despite the intense sterilisation plan (mean 381.7 sterilisations per year), the overall number of dogs entering PS did not decrease consistently across the years. Results highlighted a lack of responsibility of owners by failing to sterilise and identify their dogs and allowing intact animals to roam free, therefore producing uncontrolled and unwanted litters. The current dog population management strategy, based on both sheltering and capture-neuter-release programmes, is insufficient to tackle the straying phenomenon. Educational and sterilisation programmes should be an integral part of a successfully implemented FRD control plan. Our results provide further insight on free-roaming dog population dynamics and control systems, and may have important implications for many other local contexts across Europe trying to overcome the straying phenomenon. © 2015 Barnard S.},

abstract={Free-roaming dogs (FRD) represent a potential threat to the quality of life in cities from an ecological, social and public health point of view. One of the most urgent concerns is the role of uncontrolled dogs as reservoirs of infectious diseases transmittable to humans and, above all, rabies. An estimate of the FRD population size and characteristics in a given area is the first step for any relevant intervention programme. Direct count methods are still prominent because of their non-invasive approach, information technologies can support such methods facilitating data collection and allowing for a more efficient data handling. This paper presents a new framework for data collection using a topological algorithm implemented as ArcScript in ESRI® ArcGIS software, which allows for a random selection of the sampling areas. It also supplies a mobile phone application for Android® operating system devices which integrates Global Positioning System (GPS) and Google Maps™. The potential of such a framework was tested in 2 Italian regions. Coupling technological and innovative solutions associated with common counting methods facilitate data collection and transcription. It also paves the way to future applications, which could support dog population management systems. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={In Europe, maximum journey time for transported sheep is set at 29. h (EC Regulation 1/2005), after which animals must be unloaded, fed and watered in control posts stopping for 24. h, as all other species, before continuing their journey. The industry considers these resting times too general, not taking into account the peculiar differences between species or age classes. Also, loading and unloading have been reported to be detrimental for the animals. Therefore, the industry pushes to reduce the times at control post and avoid unloading the animals from the truck. Since there is little information concerning the effect of resting in a stationary truck after long journeys, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of an 8. h rest stop on the truck for transported ewes compared to being unloaded for resting in a control post for the same amount of time, considering physiological and behavioural measures. Two groups of ewes were transported for 29. h, after which one was unloaded and housed in a pen (P) at the control post while the other was left inside the truck (T). After 8. h stop, a further 6. h travel was headed to the farm of origin. A third group (C) stayed at the farm as control. During the stop, standing, resting, moving and eating behaviour of all groups was recorded. Blood parameters, salivary and faecal cortisol were assessed at different stages. The behaviour of P animals during the resting period was more similar to C than to T ones, where feeding and lying behaviours were restricted by the limited space allowance on the truck. After returning to the farm of origin, both T and P animals showed different parameters' levels as compared to C. P ewes showed a mean loss weight of 2. kg not recorded in group T and showed higher signs of muscular damage compared to C group. It was concluded that, with so short resting times as 8. h, there is no clear advantages in terms of animal welfare for avoiding the unloading and loading of the animals in the control post after long journeys. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Concentrations of pollutants with regulatory limits were determined in specimens of Chamelea gallina, a species of clam collected along the Abruzzi coastal region of the central Adriatic Sea. Nine sampling sites were selected to evaluate the distribution of contaminants in the environment and the health risk for consumers. The concentrations of all the examined compounds were lower than the maximums set by European legislation. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and total mercury were below the detection limit (0.18 μg/kg for benzo[a]anthracene, 0.30 μg/kg for chrysene, 0.12 μg/kg for benzo[b]fluoranthene, 0.08 μg/kg for benzo[a]pyrene, and 0.0050 mg/kg for total mercury) in all the analyzed samples. Mean concentrations of lead and cadmium were 0.104 and 0.110 mg/kg, respectively. Of the non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, PCB-153, PCB-180, and PCB-138 were the most abundant at all sampling sites (1a to 9a) at 0.25 mi (ca. 0.4 km) and at some sampling sites (1b, 2b, 3b, 5b and 7b) at 0.35 mi (ca. 0.56 km). Principal component analysis revealed that the concentrations of dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were similar at the majority of sampling sites, and O8CDD and 2,3,7,8-T4CDF were the predominant dioxin congeners.

abstract={Brucellosis is an important zoonosis caused by Brucella spp., still prevalent in most areas of the world. Brucellosis control in animals is the key to protect humans. The knowledge of Brucella spp. prevailing genotypes in a territory represents an important epidemiological tool to formulate policies and strategies for disease control and to trace back the introduction of new strains previously considered as exotic. In the last years, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been proposed as complementary to classical biotyping methods. MLVA may add important information to the classical epidemiological investigation techniques, to help in tracing back sources of infection in brucellosis outbreaks. Sardinia is an Italian region officially free from sheep and goats brucellosis since 1998. In 2011, Brucella melitensis biovar 1, a biotype not reported in Italy since 1995, was isolated in one flock in the region. The genotyping MLVA-16 showed that isolates belonged to a rare American lineage, confirming it was introduced from other countries. The strain was considered as probably originating from Spain, where this lineage is endemic. BrucellaMLVA-16 has been proved to be useful to analyse the epidemiological correlation of strains enabling to trace its geographic origin by comparing their previously reported genetic patterns. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={African horse sickness (AHS) is a vector-borne viral disease of equids, endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa. This article reports the clinic-pathological and laboratory findings observed in the framework of passive surveillance during the AHS outbreaks which occurred in Namibia between 2006 and 2013. This study was conducted in the framework of the collaboration among the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise (Teramo, Italy), the Namibian Ministry of Agriculture Water and Forestry, and the Namibian National Veterinary Association. A total of 92 horses were investigated, showing different clinical form of AHS: peracute/acute (n = 43), sub-acute (n = 21) and mild AHS fever (n = 19). Clinical data were not available for 9 horses, because they were found dead. Pathological findings have been recorded for 35 horses. At necropsy, pulmonary and subcutaneous oedema, haemorrhages and enlargement of lymph nodes were mainly observed. Diagnosis was confirmed by laboratory testing, AHS virus (AHSV) was isolated from 50 horses and the identified serotypes were: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The phylogenetic analysis of the S10 genome sequences segregated the Namibian AHSV strains in the same clusters of those circulating in South Africa in recent years. The description of AHS clinical, pathological, and laboratory features of AHS provided in this article is of value for differential diagnosis and control of AHS, especially in areas currently free from this disease. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={Bluetongue (BT) is a viral infectious non-contagious disease of domestic and wild ruminants. Insect species of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) serve as biological vectors that transmit bluetongue virus (BTV) to susceptible hosts. The infection is present in the Mediterranean region. Recently, it has also been reported in Central, Western, and Northern Europe where BTV-8 was recognised as the causative serotype. In the meantime, BTV-14 has appeared in the North-Eastern part of Europe. In the present study, BTV serotype 16 (BTV-16) was detected by virus neutralisation (VNT)-assay and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) in 1 antelope and BTV-1 in 3 of 10 Oryx antelopes (Oryx leucoryx) imported in Croatia from the Sultanate of Oman. No BTV vectors were collected during the antelope quarantine on the Veliki Brijun Island. Also, no BTV antibodies were detected in sheep, cattle, and deer on the Island. Entomological studies did not reveal any new vector species that may have been introduced with the infected antelopes on their transportation. It was the first time that BTV was demonstrated in animals imported in Croatia. It involved BTV-1, which had never been demonstrated before and BTV-16, which had been previously recorded in domestic ruminants. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

Sera of 28 pigs from a herd with reproductive problems were tested for brucellosis. Twenty-five sera (89%) were found positive to Rose Bengal Test (RBT), while 22 (79%) were positive to Complement Fixation Test (CFT). Two positive pigs were slaughtered, organs were collected and tested for the presence of bacteria. Brucella spp. was isolated from the spleens and the abdominal lymph nodes of the 2 subjects. The isolates were identified as B. suis biovar 2 by biochemical and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests. The frequent infringement in the fences of the premises and the birth of striped piglets provided evidence that sows mated with wild boar, the major reservoir of B. suis biovar 2. Conversely, the isolation of B. suis biovar 2 from spleens and lymphnodes of seropositive slaughtered animals only, as well as the constant negative results from all vaginal swabs and the abortion materials tested, raise doubts on the implication of B. suis biovar 2 in the infertility of the holding. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise "G.Caporale".

abstract={A virtual development of hexapeptide receptors bioinspired by the acetylcholinesterase enzyme active site is proposed. A semicombinatorial approach was applied to generate a virtual hexapeptides library with different affinity properties towards organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. The virtual screening process was addressed to obtain peptides able to separate pesticide subclasses in the experimental work. Three hexapeptides, two generated by molecular modeling and one having a scrambled sequence, were used as selective sorbent materials for pesticides in preanalytical solid-phase extraction (SPE) method. Selective adsorption and cross-reactivity were tested directly on a mix of four pesticides (carbaryl, chlorpyrifos-ethyl, malathion, and thiabendazole) having different structures and physico-chemical properties, at a total concentration of 120 ppb (each pesticide at concentration of 30 ppb). The results were compared to traditional sorbent material such as C-18 and strata-X. Data showed that only one of the hexapeptides virtually designed had significant differences in competitive absorption between aliphatic pesticide malathion, fungicide thiabendazole chosen as negative control, and aromatic pesticides. These results partially supported the simulated strategy. © 2015 Valentina Lanzone et al.},

abstract={Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes bluetongue, a major hemorrhagic disease of ruminants. In order to investigate the molecular determinants of BTV virulence, we used a BTV8 strain minimally passaged in tissue culture (termed BTV8<inf>L</inf> in this study) and a derivative strain passaged extensively in tissue culture (BTV8<inf>H</inf>) in in vitro and in vivo studies. BTV8<inf>L</inf> was pathogenic in both IFNAR-/- mice and in sheep, while BTV8<inf>H</inf> was attenuated in both species. To identify genetic changes which led to BTV8<inf>H</inf> attenuation, we generated 34 reassortants between BTV8<inf>L</inf> and BTV8<inf>H</inf>. We found that partial attenuation of BTV8<inf>L</inf> in IFNAR-/- mice was achieved by simply replacing genomic segment 2 (Seg2, encoding VP2) or Seg10 (encoding NS3) with the BTV8<inf>H</inf> homologous segments. Fully attenuated viruses required at least two genome segments from BTV8<inf>H</inf>, including Seg2 with either Seg1 (encoding VP1), Seg6 (encoding VP6 and NS4), or Seg10 (encoding NS3). Conversely, full reversion of virulence of BTV8<inf>H</inf> required at least five genomic segments of BTV8<inf>L</inf>. We also demonstrated that BTV8<inf>H</inf> acquired an increased affinity for glycosaminoglycan receptors during passaging in cell culture due to mutations in its VP2 protein. Replication of BTV8<inf>H</inf> was relatively poor in interferon (IFN)-competent primary ovine endothelial cells compared to replication of BTV8<inf>L</inf>, and this phenotype was determined by several viral genomic segments, including Seg4 and Seg9. This study demonstrated that multiple viral proteins contribute to BTV8 virulence. VP2 and NS3 are primary determinants of BTV pathogenesis, but VP1, VP5, VP4, VP6, and VP7 also contribute to virulence. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={African horse sickness (AHS) is a non-contagious, insect-borne disease of equids caused by a RNA virus (AHSV), which belongs to the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. The disease is endemic in sub-Saharan and western Africa, where prevention strictly depends upon vaccination. The present paper aims at evaluating the serological response and the occurrence of AHS in horses bred under field condition and regularly immunized using the commercially available live attenuated vaccine (LAV) produced by Onderstepoort Biological Products. The study was carried out in a farm located in the district of Windhoek (Namibia), where the disease is endemic. A total of 72 cross-breed horses, out of the 150 housed on the farm, were subdivided in six age groups, from 2 to 7 years-old. Each group consisted of 12 heads which were born during the same breeding season and had undergone from four to nine vaccination courses. AHSV specific immune response was evaluated by serum-virus neutralization test. Data about the clinical occurrence of the AHS from 2006 to 2011 were made available. The immune response, in terms of number of seropositive horses and serum neutralizing titers, was quite variable among horses and against different serotypes. Neutralizing antibodies against all serotypes were recorded in all the horses only after eight vaccination courses at 6 years of age onwards. Immune response to AHSV-5 and 9, which are not included in the LAV formulation, were also established. A severe AHS epidemic occurred in Namibia in 2011. On the farm under study, a total of 32 animals were clinically affected, 12 died, 11 of them were 2 year-old or younger. Our data confirm that vaccination with LAV is a useful tool to reduce the severity of the disease in endemic areas. However, clinical and sometimes fatal AHS can still affect young vaccinated horses, thus highlighting the necessity to better understand the immune response to AHSV and to dispose of more effective vaccines. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii, is a worldwide zoonosis with important consequences for human and animal health. In livestock, the diagnosis, using direct and indirect techniques, is challenging even if to tackle coxiellosis in domesticated animals a rapid diagnosis is crucial. In the recent years, new molecular methods have been developed to overcome these issues. Several polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been studied, but loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has not been fully developed. This new methodology is emerging due to simplicity and speed in diagnosis of microbial diseases. In this study, we design a new LAMP assay against C. burnetii targeting the com1 gene as an actual alternative to conventional PCR. The assay was specific to C. burnetii reactive with sensitivity comparable to standard PCR. The application of the com1 LAMP on 10 clinical samples from water buffalo, sheep, and goats, previously tested positive, confirmed the presence of C. burnetii. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of LAMP targeting C. burnetii in Europe and the results also suggest that it may be an useful and cost-effective tool for the clinical and epidemiological surveillance of Q Fever. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={African horse sickness (AHS), a non-contagious infectious disease caused by a RNA virus in the Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family affecting all equids, is endemic in sub- Saharan Africa. The virus is transmitted by some species of biting midges in the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae). In April 2011, 8 Culicoides collections were performed in 6 districts of 4 regions of the Republic of Namibia (Africa), all within a 400 km radious from the capital Windhoek. Six farms - Khomas (Windhoek and Steinhausen), Erongo (Karibib and Omaruru), Otjozondjupa (Okahandja), and Omaheke (Gobabis) involved in the AHS outbreaks, were sampled. Overall 194,211 Culicoides were collected and identified. Culicoides imicola was largely the most abundant species at all farms (99.4%). A total of 18,687 parous and gravid Culicoides females were assayed for AHS virus (AHSV) by real time RT-PCR. Of the 248 assayed pools, 227 consisted of C. imicola, 13 of Culicoides pycnostictus and 5 of Schultzei complex. Only 1 pool each of Culicoides nivosus, Culicoides leucostictus, and Culicoides tropicalis was assayed. Of the 248 pools examined by real time RT-PCR, 81 tested positive for AHSV, all consisting of C. imicola collected at Omaruru, resulting in a field vector infection rate of 0.91%. No viable AHSV could be isolated from 88 of the tested pools (n = 1,463). However, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype-1 and 10 were isolated from 3 of these pools, each consisting of 100 C. imicola collected at Windhoek. The present study confirms the relative low infection prevalence in field collected Culicoides and the strict relationship between the high abundance of C. imicola and outbreaks of AHSV. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”.

abstract={In 2013, the circulation of West Nile virus (WNV) was detected in the Lombardy region and the following year a surveillance programme was activated with the aim of early identification of the viral distribution in mosquitoes and wild birds. A total of 50 959 Culex spp. mosquitoes grouped in six hundred and forty-seven pools as well as 1400 birds were screened by RT-PCR for the presence of West Nile virus leading to the identification of the viral genome in 32 mosquito pools and 13 wild birds. The surveillance was able to detect the WNV circulation on an average of 42 days (CI 95% 29.98-53.86; Student's t-distribution) before the occurrence of human West Nile disease (WND) cases in the same area. These results demonstrate the presence of WNV in the Lombardy region and confirm entomological and wild birds surveillance as an effective measure for the early identification of WNV circulation in infected areas, thus providing a useful and cost-effective tool for the public health authorities in the application of measures to prevent human infection. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={The epidemiology of West Nile disease (WND) is influenced by multiple ecological factors and, therefore, integrated surveillance systems are needed for early detecting the infection and activating consequent control actions. As different animal species have different importance in the maintenance and in the spread of the infection, a multispecies surveillance approach is required. An integrated and comprehensive surveillance system is in place in Italy aiming at early detecting the virus introduction, monitoring the possible infection spread, and implementing preventive measures for human health.

abstract={In 2011, strains of West Nile Virus (WNV) belonging to lineage 1 spread for the first time in Sardinia region (Italy). In contrast to previous WNV Italian incursion, the strains were found in Culex modestus and, more surprisingly, they were able to cause severe clinical signs in the affected birds. Based on the partial sequence of the NS3 encoding gene, the Sardinian WNV strains demonstrated a high similarity with the other WNV strains recently detected in the Mediterranean Basin. Nonetheless, the 2011 Sardinian sequences were grouped in a distinct sub-cluster. Both the NS3-249P and NS3-249T genotypes were detected in the Sardinian outbreaks confirming that the co-circulation of different genotypes in the affected population might be common for WNV as for many RNA viruses. No association, however, was observed between virulence and viral genotype. © 2015, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise “G.Caporale”. All right reserved.},

abstract={The next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionary tools which have made possible achieving remarkable advances in genetics since the beginning of the twenty-first century. Thanks to the possibility to produce large amount of sequence data, these tools are going to completely substitute other high-throughput technologies. Moreover, the large applications of NGS protocols are increasing the genetic decoding of biological systems through studies of genome anatomy and gene mapping, coupled to the transcriptome pictures. The application of NGS pipelines such as (1) de-novo genomic sequencing by mate-paired and whole-genome shotgun strategies; (2) specific gene sequencing on large bacterial communities; and (3) RNA-seq methods including whole transcriptome sequencing and Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (Sage-analysis) are fundamental in the genome-wide fields like metagenomics. Recently, the availability of these advanced protocols has allowed to overcome the usual sequencing technical issues related to the mapping specificity over standard shotgun library sequencing, the detection of large structural genomes variations and bridging sequencing gaps, as well as more precise gene annotation. In this chapter we will discuss how to manage a successful NGS pipeline from the planning of sequencing projects through the choice of the platforms up to the data analysis management. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of gonadal alterations in the thinlip grey mullet (Liza ramada) as a biological indicator in assessing aquatic ecosystems health, with particular emphasis to river ecosystems exposed to sewage discharges. For this purpose, the reproductive status and the presence of gonadal alterations were studied in 206 mullets collected from two sites on the low course of the Tiber River, downstream of a large urban sewage treatment plant and in the estuarine area, and from an uncontaminated pond considered as reference site. Intersex and irregularly shaped gonads were observed in 20.8% of the mullets from the most polluted site, and intersex gonads in 10.3% of those from the estuarine area. No alterations were detected in the fish from the reference site, which also showed distinct stages of gonadal development. Conversely, unclear stages of testicular and ovary development were observed in the fish from the two polluted river sites. The results of this study suggest that L. ramada may represent a sentinel species in environmental risk assessment and support the use of gonadal alterations of this species as a bioindicator for extensive monitoring of pollution in lower stretches of rivers and estuarine areas. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Paratuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), is a chronic incurable infection of intestinal tract of animals. Molecular characterization of Map isolates classifies them into two major groups, 'Cattle' or Type II and 'Sheep' or Type I/III with a different phenotype, epidemiology, virulence and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine 192 Map ELISA-positive sheep and goats from Cyprus using faecal culture and genotype Map isolates using IS1311 PCR and restriction endonuclease analysis (IS1311 PCR-REA) with HinfI restriction enzyme. Map was isolated from only four (4.6%) faecal samples out of 88 sheep and 15 (14.4%) faecal samples out of 104 goats. Genotyping of the isolates using IS1311 PCR-REA revealed that sheep and goat populations on the island are infected primarily by 'Sheep' strains. Only three Map isolates from goats originated from one farm were characterized as 'Cattle' strains. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Sheep transport within Europe involves 9.5 million animals yearly, 63% of which travel over longjourneys (> 8 h). Livestock transport, particularly over long journeys, gives rise to concern about the welfare of transported animals. The European Commission stimulates the development of market-oriented animal welfare standards for all phases of livestock production, providing an alternative to the 'regulatory approach'. This study aimed to develop and test a new sheep welfare assessment protocol to be used following transport, irrespective of the journey purpose. The protocol included outcome (animal-based measures) and input variables (resource-based and management-based measures), being welfare-relevant aspects of both transport and unloading procedures. Weighted Cohen's Kappa and Heiss' Kappa index of agreement were calculated to evaluate the raters accuracy and the inter-observer reliability.Overall, good agreement levels were found. The protocol was tested on 40 commercial transports arriving at previously selected assembly centres and slaughterhouses in Italy and Greece. The protocol was found to be feasible when applied to commercial transports, allowing for a comprehensive and quick sheep welfare assessment during unloading, without impairing stockman work. Univariate analysis was carried out to evaluate associations between outcome and input variables. In this study, significant association between outcome measures and risk factors were identified when associated to unloading procedures but not to travel conditions. In collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, this protocol might be developed into a tool for routine checks for certification purposes and could provide direct feedback to all professionals involved in animal transportation on the weaknesses and strengths of their work. © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.},

abstract={Western BTV-1 emerged in the Mediterranean basin in 2006 and it has since been isolated in southern and northern European countries. Six BTV-1 strains isolated from infected sheep in Italy between 2006 and 2013 and a BTV-1 strain isolated from an infected sheep in Tunisia in 2011 were fully sequenced. The seven strains were shown to be nearly identical in each gene segment. The Seg-2 sequences of the BTV-1 strains group according to the year of isolation reflecting the time of BTV incursions in Italy. Combined results suggest that BTV-1 strains isolated in Sardinia, Sicily and mainland Italy in 2012 and 2013 have a direct northern African origin. The Italian strains originated from a strain closely related to a BTV-1 strain isolated in Tunisia in 2011. Better surveillance programs with northern and sub-Saharan African countries should be implemented making the control of spread of BTV easier and effective. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The authors designed a risk-based approach to the selection of poultry flocks to be sampled in order to further improve the sensitivity of avian influenza (AI) active surveillance programme in Cuba. The study focused on the western region of Cuba, which harbours nearly 70% of national poultry holdings and comprise several wetlands where migratory waterfowl settle (migratory waterfowl settlements - MWS). The model took into account the potential risk of commercial poultry farms in western Cuba contracting from migratory waterfowl of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes through dispersion for pasturing of migratory birds around the MWS. We computed spatial risk index by geographical analysis with Python scripts in ESRI® ArcGIS 10 on data projected in the reference system NAD 1927-UTM17. Farms located closer to MWS had the highest values for the risk indicator pj and in total 31 farms were chosen for targeted surveillance during the risk period. The authors proposed to start active surveillance in the study area 3 weeks after the onset of Anseriformes migration, with additional sampling repeated twice in the same selected poultry farms at 15 days interval (Comin et al., 2012; EFSA, 2008) to cover the whole migration season. In this way, the antibody detectability would be favoured in case of either a posterior AI introduction or enhancement of a previous seroprevalence under the sensitivity level. The model identified the areas with higher risk for AIV introduction from MW, aiming at selecting poultry premises for the application of risk-based surveillance. Given the infrequency of HPAI introduction into domestic poultry populations and the relative paucity of occurrences of LPAI epidemics, the evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach would require its application for several migration seasons to allow the collection of sufficient reliable data. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a severe respiratory disease of cattle caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) is endemic in many African countries due to fragmented veterinary services and the lack of an efficient vaccine and sensitive diagnostics. More efficient tools to control the disease are needed, but to develop the tools, a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions is necessary. The aim of this study was to characterize the kinetics of the humoral immune response against 65 Mmm surface antigens for an extended period in cattle that survived a primary infection with Mmm. We describe clinical and haematological outcomes, and dissect the humoral immune response over time, to specific antigens and compared the antibody responses between different pathomorphological outcomes. No antigen-specific antibodies correlating with protection were identified. Interestingly we found that animals that developed Mycoplasma-containing sequestra had significantly higher antibody levels against proteins comprising the surface proteome than the animals that cleared Mycoplasma from their lungs. Based on these data we suggest that high antibody titres might play a role in the establishment of pathomorphological changes, such as vasculitis, which should be investigated in future studies. Beneficial antibody specificities and cellular immune responses need to be identified in order to foster the development of an improved vaccine in the future. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={The classical microbiological method for detection of Listeria monocytogenes requires around 7. days for final confirmation, and due to perishable nature of RTE food products, there is a clear need for an alternative methodology for detection of this pathogen. This study presents an international (at European level) ISO 16140-based validation trial of a non-proprietary real-time PCR-based methodology that can generate final results in the following day of the analysis. This methodology is based on an ISO compatible enrichment coupled to a bacterial DNA extraction and a consolidated real-time PCR assay. Twelve laboratories from six European countries participated in this trial, and soft cheese was selected as food model since it can represent a difficult matrix for the bacterial DNA extraction and real-time PCR amplification. The limit of detection observed was down to 10. CFU per 25 of sample, showing excellent concordance and accordance values between samples and laboratories (>. 75%). In addition, excellent values were obtained for relative accuracy, specificity and sensitivity (82.75%, 96.70% and 97.62%, respectively) when the results obtained for the real-time PCR-based methods were compared to those of the ISO 11290-1 standard method. An interesting observation was that the L. monocytogenes detection by the real-time PCR method was less affected in the presence of Listeria innocua in the contaminated samples, proving therefore to be more reliable than the reference method.

abstract={The Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is recognized as a powerful tool to improve laboratory data management and to report human health as well as veterinary public health. LIMS plays an essential role in public health surveillance, outbreak investigations, and pandemic preparedness. The chapter aims is to provide an overview of LIMS use in veterinary fields as well as to report 20 years of experience of a Veterinary Public Institute in working with LIMS, illustrating the features of the LIMS currently in use in the institute and highlighting the different aspects that should be considered when evaluating, choosing, and implementing a LIMS. In depth, the chapter illustrates how LIMS simplifies the accreditation path according to ISO IEC 17025 and the role in the epidemiology and veterinary public health. For this aspect, it is very important to collect clear data, and for this reason, a LIMS has to activate formal checks and controls on business rules. To facilitate this issue, an interconnection between LIMS and other applications (internal or external to laboratory) could be improved to allow automatic data exchange. At the same time, the unique data encoding at national/international level should be used. © 2015 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: The increasing global importance of Rift Valley fever (RVF) is clearly demonstrated by its geographical expansion. The presence of a wide range of host and vector species, and the epidemiological characteristics of RVF, have led to concerns that epidemics will continue to occur in previously unaffected regions of Africa. The proximity of the Sahrawi territories of Western Sahara to endemic countries, such as Mauritania, Senegal, and Mali with periodic isolation of virus and serological evidence of RVF, and the intensive livestock trade in the region results in a serious risk of RVF spread in the Sahrawi territories, and potentially from there to the Maghreb and beyond. A sero-epidemiological survey was conducted in the Saharawi territories between March and April 2008 to investigate the possible presence of the RVF virus (RVFV) and associated risk factors. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used, incorporating 23 sampling sites. Results: A total of 982 serum samples was collected from 461 sheep, 463 goats and 58 camels. Eleven samples (0.97%) tested positive for IgG against the RVFV. There were clusters of high seroprevalence located mostly in the Tifariti (7.69%) and Mehaires (7.14%) regions, with the Tifariti event having been found in one single flock (4/26 positive animals). Goats and older animals were at a significantly increased risk being seropositive (p = 0.007 and p = 0.007, respectively).Conclusion: The results suggest potential RVF activity in the study area, where intense livestock movement and trade with neighbouring countries might be considered as a primary determinant in the spread of the disease. The importance of a continuous field investigation is reinforced, in light of the risk of RVF expansion to historically unaffected regions of Africa. © 2014 Di Nardo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Austropotamobius pallipes juveniles for restocking should originate from native breeders to preserve the genetic integrity of the populations. We compared the reproductive performance in captivity of A. pallipes populations of four drainage basins of the Abruzzi Region to assess their reproductive efficiency and improve their aquaculture. The broodstock were collected before the breeding season and reproduction took place in an experimental hatchery. The female carapace length ranged from 35.4 to 59.0 mm. Spawning occurred in 84% of females (range 69-93%) and the mean number of eggs per female was 89 (range 80-104). No significant differences were observed among the groups. Close to hatching, two groups maintained a high percentage of egg-bearing females (52%) and a high number of eggs, while the other groups lost most of their eggs. At the end of the cycle, the stage 2 juveniles obtained represented 19.5% of the initial egg number. The efficiency for stage 2 juvenile production ranged from 48.2 to 0.1%, and the mean number of stage 2 juveniles per female ranged from 42.2 to 1. These differences were not attributable to maternal size, but the characteristics of the brooks of origin might have influenced the reproductive performances of crayfish in the hatchery. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Tropical marine ecosystems are among the most diverse of the world oceans, so that assessing the linkages between biodiversity and ecosystem functions (BEF) is a crucial step to predict consequences of biodiversity loss. Most BEF studies in marine ecosystems have been carried out on macrobenthic diversity, whereas the influence of the meiofauna on ecosystem functioning has received much less attention. We compared meiofaunal and nematode biodiversity and prokaryotic heterotrophic production across seagrass, mangrove and reef sediments in the Caribbean, Celebes and Red Seas. For all variables we report the presence of differences among habitats within the same region, and among regions within the same habitat. In all regions, the richness of meiofaunal taxa in reef and seagrass sediments is higher than in mangrove sediments. The sediments of the Celebes Sea show the highest meiofaunal biodiversity. The composition of meiofaunal assemblages varies significantly among habitats in the same region. The nematode beta diversity among habitats within the same region is higher than the beta diversity among regions. Although one site per habitat was considered in each region, these results suggest that the composition of meiofaunal assemblages varies primarily among biogeographic regions, whereas the composition of nematode assemblages varies more considerably among habitats. Meiofauna and nematode biodiversity and prokaryotic heterotrophic production, even after the removal of covariate effects linked with longitude and the quantity and nutritional quality of organic matter, are positively and linearly linked both across regions and within each habitat type. Our results confirm that meiofauna and nematode biodiversity may influence benthic prokaryotic activity, which, in turn, implies that diversity loss could have negative impacts on ecosystem functioning in these systems. © 2014 Pusceddu et al.},

abstract={Canine distemper virus (CDV) infection is a primary threat affecting a wide number of carnivore species, including wild animals. In January 2013, two carcasses of Apennine wolves ( Canis lupus) were collected in Ortona dei Marsi (L'Aquila province, Italy) by the local Veterinary Services. CDV was immediately identified either by RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry in lung and central nervous tissue samples. At the same time, severe clinical signs consistent with CDV infection were identified and taped (Videos S1-S3) from three wolves rescued in the areas surrounding the National Parks of the Abruzzi region by the Veterinary Services. The samples collected from these symptomatic animals also turned out CDV positive by RT-PCR. So far, 30 carcasses of wolves were screened and CDV was detected in 20 of them. The sequencing of the haemagglutinin gene and subsequent phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the identified virus belonged to the CDV Arctic lineage. Strains belonging to this lineage are known to circulate in Italy and in Eastern Europe amongst domestic dogs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of CDV Arctic lineage epidemics in the wild population in Europe. © 2014 Di Sabatino et al.},

abstract={Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) is a severe cattle disease, present in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The development of improved diagnostic tests and vaccines for CBPP control remains a research priority. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were used to characterize the Triton X-114 soluble proteome of nine Mmm strains isolated from Europe or Africa. Of a total of 250 proteins detected, 67 were present in all strains investigated. Of these, 44 were predicted to be lipoproteins or cytoplasmic membrane-associated proteins and are thus likely to be members of the core in vitro surface membrane-associated proteome of Mmm. Moreover, the presence of all identified proteins in other ruminant Mycoplasma pathogens were investigated. Two proteins of the core proteome were identified only in other cattle pathogens of the genus Mycoplasma pointing towards a role in host-pathogen interactions. The data generated will facilitate the identification and prioritization of candidate Mycoplasma antigens for improved control measures, as it is likely that surface-exposed membrane proteins will include those that are involved in host-pathogen interactions. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={To assess the effect of transport duration on animal welfare and meat quality of lambs, two trials were performed: Forty Ile-de-France × Merino lambs were used in Trial 1 and 40 Comisana lambs in Trial 2. In both trials, the lambs, aged between 14 and 16 weeks, were divided into two groups of 20 animals. One group was subjected to a 1-h period of transportation (T1) and the other to a 24-h period of transportation (T24), both in the same truck and arriving to the same slaughterhouse at the same time. The effect of transport on serum biochemistry variables (cortisol, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, creatinine and total proteins), salivary cortisol, metabolites of cortisol in faeces, intra-ruminal temperature and meat quality (pH, conductivity, expressible juice, colour and shear force) was assessed. In both studies, the duration of transport did not affect serum and salivary cortisol concentration (P > 0.05). However, in Trial 2, lambs exposed to 24-h transport had a higher concentration of faecal cortisol metabolites than did those transported for 1 h (P < 0.05). Blood variables were not affected by transport in either trial (P > 0.05), with the exception of blood urea nitrogen which was higher in Trial 1 for the T24 group (P < 0.05) than it was to T1 group. Although no signs of dehydration were found, intra-ruminal loggers showed that animals did not drink during the transportation in the way they did before transport. In Trial 1, no effect of transport duration was found on meat-quality traits (P > 0.05). Nevertheless, in Trial 2, lambs exposed to 24-h transport had higher values of colour attribute of a*(red trend) and less tenderness or higher values of shear force (P < 0.05). The present study showed that although there is little effect on meat quality, signs of stress are detectable in lambs transported for 24 h. Therefore, in the case of lambs, the effect of long transportation periods must be considered more in terms of animal welfare than in terms of product quality.© 2014 CSIRO.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) transmission has been confirmed in the last four years in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin. An increasing concern towards West Nile disease (WND) has been observed due to the high number of human and animal cases reported in these areas confirming the importance of this zoonosis. A new epidemiological scenario is currently emerging: Although new introductions of the virus from abroad are always possible, confirming the epidemiological role played by migratory birds, the infection endemisation in some European territories today is a reality supported by the constant reoccurrence of the same strains across years in the same geographical areas. Despite the WND reoccurrence in the Old World, the overwintering mechanisms are not well known, and the role of local resident birds or mosquitoes in this context is poorly understood. A recent new epidemiological scenario is the spread of lineage 2 strain across European and Mediterranean countries in regions where lineage 1 strain is still circulating creating favourable conditions for genetic reassortments and emergence of new strains. This paper summarizes the main epidemiological findings on WNV occurrence in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin from 2009 to 2013, considering potential future spread patterns. © 2014 Daria Di Sabatino et al.},

abstract={Genotyping of bacteria is critical for diagnosis, treatment, and epidemiological surveillance. Coxiella burnetii, the etiological agent of Q fever, has been recognized to have a potential for bioterrorism purposes. Because few serosurveys have been conducted in Italy, there is still limited information about the distribution of this pathogen in natural conditions. In this paper, we describe the genotyping of C. burnetii strains by multispacer sequence typing (MST) detected in cattle and goat farms in the Abruzzi region of Italy. Biological samples (milk, aborted fetus) positive for C. burnetii DNA were sequenced in the spacer regions and compared with those already publicly available (http://ifr48.timone.univ-mrs.fr/MST-Coxiella/mst/group-detail). The MST profile of C. burnetii detected in milk samples demonstrated the presence of a new allele, whereas the C. burnetii spacer sequences from fetus and milk goat samples displayed a new allelic combination. The results suggest the circulation of novel genotypes of C. burnetii in Italy. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={The retrospective study of the results of the analysed samples is a fundamental tool for the identification of major risk related to food and for planning future monitoring activities. The evaluation of the quality of data collected may also allow for estimating the effectiveness of the controls so to improve their efficacy. In this article, the authors evaluated the results of tests for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes performed by the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell’Abruzzo e del Molise ‘G. Caporale’ (IZSAM) on food samples collected during the years 2000-2009 in the territory of Avezzano, Sulmona and Castel di Sangro (province of L’Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy). The comparison of the data examined with those from studies conducted in Italy and in other countries shows that the categories with higher percentages of positivity for Listeria monocytogenes are meat and fish products. Data collected do not indicate cheese as a vehicle of contamination in the sampled areas, in contrast to what reported in the national and international literature. It would therefore be necessary to promote an ad hoc sampling in the areas covered by this study to verify this aspect in more depth. © 2014 Istituto G. Caporale.},

abstract={The European region has been, and remains, a global leader in the development of animal welfare policies. The region has a great diversity of cultures and religions, different levels of socio-economic development, and varied legislation, policies and practices. Nevertheless, there are common drivers for animal welfare policy based on a history of animal welfare ethics and obligations to animal users and society in general. A unifying goal of countries in the region is to achieve sustainable compliance with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) standards on animal health and welfare. Ethics isthe overarching driver, supported by the actions of governmental, inter-governmental and non-governmental activities, markets and trade, science and knowledge. Historically, organisations involved in promoting animal welfare have tended to act in isolation. For example, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have run campaigns to influence retailers and the welfare policies of their farmer suppliers. Increasingly, different organisations with common or complementary goals are working together. For example, competent authorities, inter-governmental bodies and NGOs have combined their efforts to address dog population control across several countries in the region. Also, animal welfare is becoming integrated into the corporate social responsibility targets of private companies. Science and knowledge, as drivers and tools, are assisting with the harmonisation of welfare standards, e.g. by providing a common basis for measuring welfare impacts through animal-based measures and widespread sharing of this information. Current trends suggest that there will be greater collaboration among the organisations driving change, and increasing convergence of animal welfare strategies and welfare assessment tools. The result will be increased harmonisation of animal welfare standards throughout the region.},

This study describes the setup of a fast and robust next-generation sequencing (NGS) Ion PGM™ protocol that was used to obtain the complete genome sequence of a CDV isolate (CDV2784/2013). CDV2784/2013 is the prototype of CDV strains responsible for severe clinical distemper in dogs and wolves in Italy during 2013. CDV2784/2013 was isolated on cell culture and total RNA was used for NGS sample preparation. A total of 112.3. Mb of reads were assembled de novo using MIRA version 4.0rc4, which yielded a total number of 403 contigs with 12.1% coverage. The whole genome (15,690. bp) was recovered successfully and compared to those of existing CDV whole genomes. CDV2784/2013 was shown to have 92% nt identity with the Onderstepoort vaccine strain. This study describes for the first time a fast and robust Ion PGM™ platform-based whole genome amplification protocol for non-segmented negative stranded RNA viruses starting from total cell-purified RNA. Additionally, this is the first study reporting the whole genome analysis of an Arctic lineage strain that is known to circulate widely in Europe, Asia and USA. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Heartwater (HW) is tick-borne rickettsiosis, caused by Ehrlichia ruminantium (in the past known as Cowdria ruminantium) transmitted by hard ticks of the Amblyomma genus. It spreads in sub Saharan Africa and its economic impact on livestock is high, secondary only to that of East Coast fever and African trypanosomosis and represents a major obstacle to ruminants production. The Ambylomma genus occurs worldwide, with the exception of Europe. Heartwater distribution is mainly affected by the distribution of the 5 main natural vectors, all of African origin. Of these, Amblyomma variegatum (Tropical Bont Tick - TBT) is most widespread. Even if the introduction and the establishment of HW and its vectors in Mediterranean area is unlikely, it can be considered at risk of introduction, since A. variegatum has been seldom reported in area, probably introduced by migratory birds. Moreover, A. variegatum and E. ruminantium were already introduced outside Africa moving cattle from Senegal into the Caribbean, where A. variegatum colonization has been boosted by favourable ecological conditions, leading to the establishment of the tick and of the infection in the region. The study described was conducted in the framework of the activities of the preparedness policy of the National Reference Centre for Exotic Diseases (CESME) at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise (IZSAM) in cooperation with Namibian Veterinary Services. Ten selected Dorper Sheep, five years old, were infected intravenously by infective blood containing the E. ruminantium Ball 3 stock (OBP). Sheep were kept under observation till 36 day p.i. and temperature registered. Blood samples and tissues during necropsy were collected for PCR test. Respiratory symptoms and HW lesions were observed (idrotorax and idropercardium). PCR on blood was positive only in case of febrile animal, brain confirmed as choice for post mortem laboratory diagnosis using PCR test. Clinical symptoms and lesions have been observed, allowing to improve diagnostic skills for HW. Ball3 stock, improperly called vaccine, is confirmed to cause clinical disease and livestock losses if injected animals are not properly and timely treated with tetracycline.},

abstract={Introduction - Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) caused a massive epidemic in Europe in 2006-2007. In response to this epidemic, large-scale vaccination campaigns of susceptible species were implemented in most European countries starting from the spring of 2008, when inactivated BTV-8 vaccines became available on the market. In Italy, the first evidence of BTV-8 circulation was reported in March 2008 from five dairy cattle herds in the province of Verona. Compulsory vaccination was then implemented in the two adjoining provinces of Verona and Mantua. Aim - This study aims at determining the prevalence of vaccine-elicited BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies in dairy cattle 29-47 months after vaccination. As infected and vaccinated animals cannot be differentiated serologically, information on the postvaccination antibody dynamic under field conditions is crucial to implement surveillance activities. Materials and methods - A cross-sectional serosurvey of vaccine-elicited BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies in dairy cattle was performed in the province of Verona; 110 cows housed in 12 farms vaccinated during the 2008 campaign, and 270 cows housed in 28 farms vaccinated during both 2008 and 2009 campaigns, were sampled in 2012. Eighty-four non-vaccinated heifers born from 2010 onwards were also sampled to confirm absence of virus circulation in the sampled herds after vaccination. All samples were tested for BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies using virus neutralization assay. Differences in seroprevalence between cows receiving one or two vaccinations (2008 vs. 2008 and 2009) were tested with χ2 test. The analysis considered stratification of samples according to herd size and vaccination schedule, clustering of animals at the herd level, and sampling weights as to weight the sample back to the population from which it was drawn. Results and discussion - Overall seroprevalence was 43.1% (95% confidence interval: 41.8-44.5%), relatively low compared to that of similar surveys performed in other countries. Seroprevalence in cows vaccinated once was 30.4% (29.3-31.5%), significantly lower than that in cows vaccinated twice (48.3%, 46.5-50.2%). Antibody titres ranged from log<inf>10</inf> 1.00 to 2.51 (mean 1.36). None of the 84 non-vaccinated heifers had detectable BTV-8 neutralizing antibodies, confirming absence of virus circulation in the sampled herds after vaccination. Conclusions - A seroprevalence of 43.1% was evidenced in Italian dairy cattle 29-47 months post-vaccination. Although neutralizing antibodies are being waned sooner in formerly, non-repeatedly vaccinated animals, for at least 47 months vaccinated animals cannot be included in (sero)surveillance programmes. The fact that many vaccinated animals are likely to still be protected by vaccination during that period provides an explanation of why the devastating 2006-2007 European BTV-8 epidemic was so efficiently controlled despite most vaccination campaigns were stopped after two years.},

abstract={Despite pattern recognition methods for human behavioral analysis has flourished in the last decade, animal behavioral analysis has been almost neglected. Those few approaches are mostly focused on preserving livestock economic value while attention on the welfare of companion animals, like dogs, is now emerging as a social need. In this work, following the analogy with human behavior recognition, we propose a system for recognizing body parts of dogs kept in pens. We decide to adopt both 2D and 3D features in order to obtain a rich description of the dog model. Images are acquired using the Microsoft Kinect to capture the depth map images of the dog. Upon depth maps a Structural Support Vector Machine (SSVM) is employed to identify the body parts using both 3D features and 2D images. The proposal relies on a kernelized discriminative structural classificator specifically tailored for dogs independently from the size and breed. The classification is performed in an online fashion using the LaRank optimization technique to obtaining real time performances. Promising results have emerged during the experimental evaluation carried out at a dog shelter, managed by IZSAM, in Teramo, Italy. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to establish whether climate change affected migratory behaviour of Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), which is an important resource for small-scale fishermen of Abruzzo region (Italy). Starting at the beginning of March until the end of April, the cuttlefish in this area migrates from deep cold water towards warmer coastal waters, where they spawn. Small-scale fishing of cuttlefish is permitted in costal waters from March to September. During the study period, between March and September 2008, both cuttlefish traps and trammel nets were used in 5 sampling areas along the Abruzzo coast to test their relative efficiency in catching cuttlefish. Trapped specimens were counted, weighed and measured, their gender and sexual maturity were also determined. The data obtained from the sampling were correlated to surface water temperature to assess possible changes in migration behaviours. The obtained data show that during the first months of migration (March and April), a greater percentage of large males was caught, while females and smaller males predominated later in the year. The study also showed that surface water temperature did not reveal any significant shifts from the trend over the last 10 years. As for the efficiency of the fishing methods, traps were found to be more effective than trammel nets.},

abstract={Since 1994, when Brucella ceti was first isolated from an aborted dolphin fetus, several cases have been reported worldwide. The first case of B. ceti in the Mediterranean (and in Italy), however, was recorded only in 2012, off the coast of Tuscany. Extensive studies, using serological and microbiological methods, have documented this bacterium in dolphins and demonstrated its zoonotic potential. We describe the typing of two B. ceti strains isolated from striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) stranded on the southern Apulia coastline. B. ceti isolates were conventionally typed, and then genotyped by both the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and the multilocus variable number of tandem repeats typing (MLVA) methodologies to infer phylogeny and potential epidemiological links between the two cases. The two isolates were identified through MLST analysis as belonging to the common sequence type 26 (ST26), while MLVA analysis, having established that the two isolates have identical profiles, assigned them to a novel genotype within cluster A - a unique representative of a new Mediterranean subcluster. The results thus revealed a link between the two cases studied, demonstrating the usefulness of MLST and MLVA for the epidemiological investigation of brucellae among marine mammals. © 2014 SGM.},

abstract={A customized DNA microarray was designed to detect Escherichia coli virulence genes in addition to Gram-negative genes conferring resistance to antimicrobials belonging to the aminoglycoside, β-lactam, tetracycline, sulfonamide, phenicol, and quinolone families as well as to rifampin, erythromycin, trimethoprim, olaquindox, quaternary ammonium compound resistant determinant genes, and mobile genetic elements such as class 1, 2, 3 integrons and transposon Tn21. This microarray was applied in the genotyping of two collection strains coming from colibacillosis outbreaks in rabbit and cattle facilities located in Italy and Iran, respectively. For each collection, the positive gene distribution and frequency per encoded enzyme or protein involved in antimicrobial resistance was first determined. Thereafter, strains positive for integrons were matched with the presence of transposon Tn21 (tnpM gene) in order to highlight the genetic potential of resistance (multi-resistance) transferability in the examined strains. Fourteen of 26 strains in our rabbit E. coli collection were positive for a class 1 integron, six of which were associated with the tnpM gene and multidrug resistancerelated genes to the aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide-trimethoprim antimicrobial families, prevalently. Class 1 and/or class 2 and 3 integrons were also detected in 23 out of 51 strains in our cattle E. coli collection, 13 of which were also positive for tnpM gene. The presence of multiple drug resistance involving the aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamide antimicrobial families are positively associated with this tnpM gene group. Moreover, strains having positive genes for integrons and transposons were also carriers, to a lesser extent, of class A and/or class C β-lactamase (11 strains) and quinolone (9 strains) resistant genes. The DNA microarray used in this chapter has proven to be a powerful tool in determining the genetic profile of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli field strains. The DNA microarray technology may be an appropriate technology for inclusion in antimicrobial resistance monitoring programs because of its adaptability to and ease of data collection for any particular monitoring program. Furthermore, this technology could be used to assess the effectiveness of antimicrobial use-reduction plans or in comparative studies between traditional and antibiotic-free animal production systems. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={The levels and specific profiles of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DL-PCBs) in Mytilus galloprovincialis from the Mar Grande and the Mar Piccolo of Taranto were determined during the extensive monitoring plan of Local Health Authority to assess PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs contamination in food and farm products, within 20 km from the industrial areas of Taranto, between March and December 2011. The average Total Toxicity Equivalence (TEQ) values for the sum of PCDD/F and DL-PCBs ranged from 1.61 to 5.63 pg WHO2005-TEQ g−1 wet weight basis, with the highest in the first inlet of the Mar Piccolo. In particular, DL-PCBs were the dominant chemicals in all samples, followed by PCDFs and PCDDs. Congener patterns in mussels were similar, indicating a homogeneous behavior in studied areas and, probably, the same type of source. The seasonal concentrations trend showed a relevant increase of dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs TEQs during the summer months, exceeding the limits set by the European Community for food and foodstuff.

abstract={Following its spread in the USA, West Nile Virus (WNV) has reemerged in the Mediterranean basin with a renewed pathogenicity. The introduction of WNV lineage 2 in Europe and its co-circulation with lineage 1 has resulted in a continuously changing epidemiological scenario, highlighting the importance of differential detection of the two lineages. The paper describes a new real-time PCR method for the detection and genotyping of the two main lineages of WNV. The method requires a single pair of primers and probes and is based on the analysis of highly conserved consensus sequences detected in the 5' terminus of the viral genome. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Naples and Caserta provinces are extensively affected by the illegal dumping of hazardous and urban wastes, which were periodically set to fire. Several studies were made on the possible health impact of this illegal waste management. The aim of the study was to detect dioxins levels in breast milk of volunteer primiparae and to assess the possible source of dioxins in the affected areas. The authors determined dioxins levels in breast milk from 100 primiparae from the study area and collected anamnestic information on donors. We determined dioxins levels in breast milk from 100 primiparae from the study area and collected anamnestic information on donors. As a measure of environmental risk of dioxins (EDR) we used the interpolated values of dioxins concentration in buffalo milk samples collected in the study area. Correlations between the EDR, age of the mother, smoking habit, cheese consumption, occupation in activity at risk, presence of plants for the disposal of toxic waste or illegal burning of solid waste near the residence of the donor and dioxin level in breast milk were investigated. The dioxin level in breast milk is significantly correlated to the EDR, the age of the sampled women and the presence of illegal burning of solid waste. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to determine ochratoxin A (OTA) concentrations in the raw materials and cooked meat products made from pigs sub-chronically exposed to OTA. The treated animal group (n. = 5) was administered with 300. μg OTA/kg of feed for 30. days, whereas the control group (n. = 5) was left untreated. OTA concentrations were quantified using immunoassay (ELISA) and high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD). OTA concentration was the highest in the kidney, followed by the lungs, liver, blood, spleen, heart, and adipose tissue. As for the final meat products, the highest average OTA concentration was detected in black pudding sausages (14.02. ±. 2.75. μg/kg), then in liver sausages (13.77. ±. 3.92. μg/kg), while the lowest was found in pâté (9.33. ±. 2.66. μg/kg). The results pointed out that a sub-chronic pig exposure leads to the accumulation of OTA in raw materials and consequently in meat products, whose level of contamination is directly dependent on OTA contents in raw materials used for their production. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In the European Union, β2-adrenergic agonists like clenbuterol and salbutamol are banned from use as growth promoters. Although clenbuterol and salbutamol both accumulate in the liver, differences in the accumulation rate can be seen among animal species due to different β2-adrenoreceptor distributions. The aim of this study was to compare the accumulation of the two in the liver tissue of two different mouse strains. The study included 200 8-week-old BALB/c and C57/BL/6 mice. One group of BALB/c (40) and one group of C57/ BL/6 (40) mice were treated with 2.5 mg/kg body mass clenbuterol per os for 28 days. The remaining two animal groups were treated with salbutamol in the same manner. The animals were then randomly sacrificed on day 1, 15 and 30 post treatments. Despite of the same treatment dose, the results revealed clenbuterol to persist in the liver tissue longer than salbutamol. On post treatment day 30, the concentration of clenbuterol residue in C57/BL/6 and BALB/c mice liver tissue were 0.23±0.02 and 0.21±0.03 ng/g, respectively, while residues of salbutamol were not detected. When comparing the accumulation of both compounds between the two mouse strains, it becomes apparent that no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) in the accumulation rate can be found. ©2014.

abstract={Few reports of human Usutu virus (USUV) infection have been reported to date. We describe the first three patients with USUV neuroinvasive infection in Zagreb and its surroundings from 30 August to 7 September 2013 during a West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak. Patients were aged 29, 56, and 61 years. The two older patients had several comorbidities (arterial hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus). All patients presented with meningitis and meningoencephalitis closely resembling WNV neuroinvasive disease. The main clinical features in all patients were headache, fever, nuchal rigidity, hand tremor, and hyperreflexia. Neuroimaging studies were normal and electroencephalography (EEG) revealed diffusely slow activity. The 29 years old, a previously healthy female patient, was deeply somnolent and disoriented for 4 days. Her recovery was slow and even 10 weeks after disease onset, she had memory and speech-fluency difficulties. The other two patients recovered promptly. USUV IgG antibodies were detected in all patients by ELISA with seroconversion documented in two of them. Titers of USUV-neutralizing antibodies were 10, 80, and 10, respectively. Because USUV and WNV share many clinical characteristics, USUV infection could be misdiagnosed as WNV. Testing for USUV should be considered in all suspected cases of meningoencephalitis, especially in areas where both viruses cocirculate. © 2014, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.},

abstract={Bluetongue is a major infectious disease of ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), an arbovirus transmitted by Culicoides. Here, we assessed virus and host factors influencing the clinical outcome of BTV infection using a single experimental framework. We investigated how mammalian host species, breed, age, BTV serotypes, and strains within a serotype affect the clinical course of bluetongue. Results obtained indicate that in small ruminants, there is a marked difference in the susceptibility to clinical disease induced by BTV at the host species level but less so at the breed level. No major differences in virulence were found between divergent serotypes (BTV-8 and BTV-2). However, we observed striking differences in virulence between closely related strains of the same serotype collected toward the beginning and the end of the European BTV-8 outbreak. As observed previously, differences in disease severity were also observed when animals were infected with either blood from a BTV-infected animal or from the same virus isolated in cell culture. Interestingly, with the exception of two silent mutations, full viral genome sequencing showed identical consensus sequences of the virus before and after cell culture isolation. However, deep sequencing analysis revealed a marked decrease in the genetic diversity of the viral population after passaging in mammalian cells. In contrast, passaging in Culicoides cells increased the overall number of low-frequency variants compared to virus never passaged in cell culture. Thus, Culicoides might be a source of new viral variants, and viral population diversity can be another factor influencing BTV virulence. © 2014 Caporale et al.},

abstract={Bunyaviruses have evolved a variety of strategies to counteract the antiviral defence systems of mammalian cells. Here we show that the NSs protein of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) induces the degradation of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II and consequently inhibits global cellular protein synthesis and the antiviral response. In addition, we show that the SBV NSs protein enhances apoptosis in vitro and possibly in vivo, suggesting that this protein could be involved in SBV pathogenesis in different ways. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Six serological assays for the diagnosis of ovine brucellosis, due to Brucella melitensis were evaluated. Reference serum samples from sheep of known B. melitensis infection status (n= 118) were assessed using the Rose Bengal test (RBT), complement fixation test (CFT) and four commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), including two indirect ELISAs (iELISAs), one competitive ELISA (cELISA) and one blocking ELISA (bELISA).The highest differential positive rates (DPR) were obtained with the cELISA and bELISA, while the lowest DPR was estimated using iELISAs. A latent class analysis was performed to estimate the accuracy of the CFT, RBT and bELISA using 1827 sera from sheep undergoing testing as part of a surveillance and control programme. Lower sensitivity and specificity were obtained for the three serological tests when the field samples were used. A higher DPR was achieved by the CFT, compared to bELISA and RBT. The results suggest that ELISAs, and particularly the bELISA, might be suitable for inclusion in the European Union legislation on intra-community trade for diagnosing B. melitensis infection in sheep, as it has a similar test performance compared to the RBT. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Schmallenberg virus (SBV), a novel arboviral pathogen, has emerged and spread across Europe since 2011 inflicting congenital deformities in the offspring of infected adult ruminants. Several species of Culicoides biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) have been implicated in the transmission of SBV through studies conducted in northern Europe. In this study Culicoides from SBV outbreak areas of mainland France and Italy (Sardinia) were screened for viral RNA. The role of both C. obsoletus and the Obsoletus complex (C. obsoletus and C. scoticus) in transmission of SBV were confirmed in France and SBV was also discovered in a pool of C. nubeculosus for the first time, implicating this species as a potential vector. While collections in Sardinia were dominated by C. imicola, only relatively small quantities of SBV RNA were detected in pools of this species and conclusive evidence of its potential role in transmission is required. In addition to these field-based studies, infection rates in colony-derived individuals of C. nubeculosus and field-collected C. scoticus are also examined in the laboratory. Rates of infection in C. nubeculosus were low, confirming previous studies, while preliminary examination of C. scoticus demonstrated that while this species can replicate SBV to a potentially transmissible level, further work is required to fully define comparative competence between species in the region. Finally, the oral competence for SBV of two abundant and widespread mosquito vector species in the laboratory is assessed. Neither Aedes albopictus nor Culex pipiens were demonstrated to replicate SBV to transmissible levels and appear unlikely to play a major role in transmission. Other vector competence data produced from studies across Europe to date is then comprehensively reviewed and compared with that generated previously for bluetongue virus. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae included in the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex (JEAC). A seroepidemiological study was carried out in 2011 using 160 horse sera collected from different areas of Bolivia to investigate the presence of WNV antibody. A high proportion (59.4%) of the tested sera were positive to a commercially available WNV competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA). Sixty-six randomly selected C-ELISA-positive sera were further tested by WNV plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), virus neutralization (VN), and immunoglobulin M (IgM)-WNV ELISA to exclude false-positive results due to possible cross-reactions to other members of the JEAC and to investigate if the horses were recently infected. No WNV IgM was detected in these samples, whereas neutralizing antibodies were found in 21 and 18 samples by PRNT and VN, respectively. In conclusion, a high proportion of the Bolivian horses included in this study reacted serologically against viruses of the JEAC. WNV was partially responsible (31.8%) for these reactions, supporting the conclusion that WNV circulated in Bolivia. © 2013 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={A case is made for greater emphasis to be placed on value chain management as an alternative to geographically based disease risk mitigation for trade in commodities and products derived from animals. The geographic approach is dependent upon achievement of freedom in countries or zones from infectious agents that cause so-called transboundary animal diseases, while value chain-based risk management depends upon mitigation of animal disease hazards potentially associated with specific commodities or products irrespective of the locality of production. This commodity-specific approach is founded on the same principles upon which international food safety standards are based, viz. hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP). Broader acceptance of a value chain approach enables animal disease risk management to be combined with food safety management by the integration of commodity-based trade and HACCP methodologies and thereby facilitates 'farm to fork' quality assurance. The latter is increasingly recognized as indispensable to food safety assurance and is therefore a pre-condition to safe trade. The biological principles upon which HACCP and commodity-based trade are based are essentially identical, potentially simplifying sanitary control in contrast to current separate international sanitary standards for food safety and animal disease risks that are difficult to reconcile. A value chain approach would not only enable more effective integration of food safety and animal disease risk management of foodstuffs derived from animals but would also ameliorate adverse environmental and associated socio-economic consequences of current sanitary standards based on the geographic distribution of animal infections. This is especially the case where vast veterinary cordon fencing systems are relied upon to separate livestock and wildlife as is the case in much of southern Africa. A value chain approach would thus be particularly beneficial to under-developed regions of the world such as southern Africa specifically and sub-Saharan Africa more generally where it would reduce incompatibility between attempts to expand and commercialize livestock production and the need to conserve the subcontinent's unparalleled wildlife and wilderness resources. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) represent an important group of viral agents responsible for vector-borne zoonotic diseases constituting an emerging sanitary threat for the Mediterranean Basin and the neighbouring countries. WNV infection is present in several Mediterranean countries, whereas RVF has never been introduced into Europe, but it is considered a major threat for North African countries. Being vector-borne diseases, they cannot be prevented only through an animal trade control policy. Several approaches are used for the surveillance of WNV and RVFV. With the aim of assessing the surveillance systems in place in Mediterranean countries, two disease-specific questionnaires (WNV, RVFV) have been prepared and submitted to Public Health and Veterinary Authorities of six EU countries. This study presents the information gathered through the questionnaires and describes some critical points in the prevention and surveillance of these diseases as emerged by the answers received. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Summary: The interaction between living beings, including men, animals and pathogens, sharing the same environment, should be considered as a unique dynamic system, in which the health of each component is inextricably interconnected and dependent with the others. Nowadays, a new integrated One Health approach is reflecting this interdependence with a holistic view to the ecological system. The One Health approach can be defined as a collaborative and a multidisciplinary effort at local, national and global level to guarantee an optimal healthy status for humans, animals and environment. Strictly related to the One Health concept is to be considered the control of infectious diseases, which have influenced the course of human history. Four different components might be identified as key elements within the 'One World - One Health' (OWOH) approach: the geographical component, the ecological one, the human activities and the food-agricultural ones. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Summary: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a severe mosquito-borne disease that is caused by a Phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae) and affects domestic ruminants and humans. Recently, its distribution widened, threatening Europe. The probability of the introduction and large-scale spread of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in Europe is low, but localized RVF outbreaks may occur in areas where populations of ruminants and potential vectors are present. In this study, we assumed the introduction of the virus into Italy and focused on the risk of vector-borne transmission of RVFV to three main European potential hosts (cattle, sheep and goats). Five main potential mosquito vectors belonging to the Culex and Aedes genera that are present in Italy were identified in a literature review. We first modelled the geographical distribution of these five species based on expert knowledge and using land cover as a proxy of mosquito presence. The mosquito distribution maps were compared with field mosquito collections from Italy to validate the model. Next, the risk of RVFV transmission was modelled using a multicriteria evaluation (MCE) approach, integrating expert knowledge and the results of a literature review on host sensitivity and vector competence, feeding behaviour and abundance. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results with respect to expert choices. The resulting maps include (i) five maps of the vector distribution, (ii) a map of suitable areas for vector-borne transmission of RVFV and (iii) a map of the risk of RVFV vector-borne transmission to sensitive hosts given a viral introduction. Good agreement was found between the modelled presence probability and the observed presence or absence of each vector species. The resulting RVF risk map highlighted strong spatial heterogeneity and could be used to target surveillance. In conclusion, the geographical information system (GIS)-based MCE served as a valuable framework and a flexible tool for mapping the areas at risk of a pathogen that is currently absent from a region. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Translation of influenza A virus PB1-F2 occurs in a second open reading frame (ORF) of the PB1 gene segment. PB1-F2 has been implicated in regulation of polymerase activity, immunopathology, susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection, and induction of apoptosis. Experimental evidence of PB1-F2 molecular function during infection has been collected primarily from human and avian viral isolates. As the 2009 H1N1 (H1N1pdm09) strain highlighted, some swine-derived influenza viruses have the capacity to infect human hosts and emerge as a pandemic. Understanding the impact that virulence factors from swine isolates have on both human and swine health could aid in early identification of viruses with pandemic potential. Studies examining PB1-F2 from swine isolates have focused primarily on H1N1pdm09, which does not encode PB1-F2 but was engineered to carry a full-length PB1-F2 ORF to assess the impact on viral replication and pathogenicity. However, experimental evidence of PB1-F2 protein expression from swine lineage viruses has not been demonstrated. Here, we reveal that during infection, PB1-F2 expression levels are substantially different in swine and human influenza viruses. We provide evidence that PB1-F2 expression is regulated at the translational level, with very low levels of PB1-F2 expression from swine lineage viruses relative to a human isolate PB1-F2. Translational regulation of PB1-F2 expression was partially mapped to two independent regions within the PB1 mRNA, located downstream of the PB1-F2 start site. Our data suggest that carrying a full-length PB1-F2 ORF may not be predictive of PB1-F2 expression in infected cells for all influenza A viruses. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

The study was divided into the following phases: development and application of artificial surfaces at specific sites of the Molise coast in Italy; induction of eggs hatching and juveniles maintenance under controlled condition; juveniles introduction into specific sites and assessment their increment; experimental data elaboration. The obtained results concerned both the effectiveness of the artificial surfaces tasted during the study and the importance of the recovery of the eggs laid on artificial surfaces (artefacts and fishing gear) for preservation and the management of the Sepia officinalis resource. The induction tests conducted on eggs hatching under controlled conditions confirmed what described in the extant literature. Water salinity was detected as the only limiting factor, with values ≤ 20% related to the absence of hatching. The described practices for harvesting and induction of hatching for the production of juvenile cuttlefish may be endorsed by the operators at relatively low cost and throughout the year, with obvious economic benefits. © Istituto G.

abstract={Brucellosis, one of the most important re-emerging zoonoses in many countries, is caused by bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella. Furthermore these bacteria represent potential biological warfare agents and the identification of species and biovars of field strains may be crucial for tracing back source of infection, allowing to discriminate naturally occurring outbreaks instead of bioterrorist events. In the last years, multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been proposed as complement of the classical biotyping methods and it has been applied for genotyping large collections of Brucella spp. At present, the MLVA band profiles may be resolved by automated or manual procedures. The Lab on a chip technology represents a valid alternative to standard genotyping techniques (as agarose gel electrophoresis) and it has been previously used for Brucella genotyping. Recently, a new high-throughput genotyping analysis system based on capillary gel electrophoresis, the QIAxcel, has been described. The aim of the study was to evaluate the ability of two DNA sizing equipments, the QIAxcel System and the Lab chip GX, to correctly call alleles at the sixteen loci including one frequently used MLVA assay for Brucella genotyping. The results confirmed that these technologies represent a meaningful advancement in high-throughput Brucella genotyping. Considering the accuracy required to confidently resolve loci discrimination, QIAxcel shows a better ability to measure VNTR allele sizes compared to LabChip GX. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Despite the eradication of brucellosis from most of Europe, the disease remains relatively common in a variety of livestock in southern European countries. It is therefore surprising that with such high prevalence rates, there have been few genetic characterizations of brucellosis outbreaks in this region. We conducted a genetic assessment of 206 isolates of Brucella abortus and B. melitensis from Italy using Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VNTRs). We determined genetic diversity and geographic distribution of these Brucella VNTR genotypes from 160 farms in eight regions of Southern Italy in a fine-scale analysis using 16 VNTR loci in a MLVA-16 methodology. In a broad scale analysis, we then used a reduced dataset of 11 VNTR loci (MLVA-11) to compare genotypes from Italy to a global database. In the 84 isolates of B. melitensis, there were 56 genotypes using MLVA-16; 43 of these genotypes were found only once. At a broad scale, 81 of these isolates were part of an Italian sub-group within the West Mediterranean group. One of the two B. melitensis isolates from a human patient shared the same genotype as a livestock isolate, suggesting a possible epidemiological connection. In 122 B. abortus isolates, there were 34 genotypes by MLVA-16; 16 of these genotypes were found only once. At a broad scale with MLVA-11, one genotype was predominant, comprising 77.8% of the isolates and was distributed throughout Southern Italy.

abstract={Summary: Since 2000, several incursions of bluetongue virus (BTV) occurred in the Mediterranean Basin involving European and surrounding Countries. The Middle East represents one of the most important gateways for the access of BTV in Europe. Limited data on the BTV situation in this area are available. In this perspective, an epidemiological survey on the presence of BTV in Lebanon was conducted. Of the 181 serum samples tested, 97 (mean = 53.6%; 95% CI: 46.3-60.7) resulted positive when tested for the presence of BTV antibodies by c-ELISA, of these 42 (mean = 42%; 95% CI: 32.8-51.8) serum samples were from sheep and 55 (mean = 67.9%; 95% CI: 57.1-77.1) serum samples were from goats. Fourteen blood samples (14/110; mean = 12.7%; 95% CI: 7.8-20.3), 6 (6/66; mean = 9.1%; 95% CI: 4.4-18.5) from sheep and 8 (8/44; mean = 18.2%; 95% CI: 9.6-32.0) from goats, were positive by qRT-PCR. The results with serum-neutralization assay and typing performed by RT-PCR confirmed that six BTV serotypes are currently circulating in Lebanon, and these serotypes are as follows: 1, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 24. This study is the first report that confirms the presence and circulation of BTV in Lebanon. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Since 2000 several bluetongue virus (BTV) incursions have occurred in Sardinia (Italy) involving serotypes 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16. In October 2012, new BT outbreaks caused by BTV-1 and BTV-4 were reported. Nearly 500 flocks were infected and 9238 sheep died because of the infection. When sequenced, Seg-10 of both strains shared 99% similarity at nucleotide level with BTV strains that have circulated in the Mediterranean basin in the last few years. Similarly, Seg-5 sequences of BTV-1 and BTV-4 newly isolated Sardinian strains are identical and cluster together with recent BTV-1 circulating in the Mediterranean Basin and the BTV-4 strains isolated in Tunisia in 2007 and 2009. These BTV-4 strains differ from the ones that circulated in Europe from 2003 to 2005 and appear to be reassortant strains. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Transplacental transmission of bluetongue virus has been shown previously for the North European strain of serotype 8 (BTV-8) and for tissue culture or chicken egg-adapted vaccine strains but not for field strains of other serotypes. In this study, pregnant ewes (6 per group) were inoculated with either field or rescued strains of BTV-2 and BTV-8 in order to determine the ability of these viruses to cross the placental barrier. The field BTV-2 and BTV-8 strains was passaged once in Culicoides KC cells and once in mammalian cells. All virus inoculated sheep became infected and seroconverted against the different BTV strains used in this study. BTV RNA was detectable in the blood of all but two ewes for over 28 days but infectious virus could only be detected in the blood for a much shorter period. Interestingly, transplacental transmission of BTV-2 (both field and rescued strains) was demonstrated at high efficiency (6 out of 13 lambs born to BTV-2 infected ewes) while only 1 lamb of 12 born to BTV-8 infected ewes showed evidence of in utero infection. In addition, evidence for horizontal transmission of BTV-2 between ewes was observed. As expected, the parental BTV-2 and BTV-8 viruses and the viruses rescued by reverse genetics showed very similar properties to each other. This study showed, for the first time, that transplacental transmission of BTV-2, which had been minimally passaged in cell culture, can occur; hence such transmission might be more frequent than previously thought. © 2013 Rasmussen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Following the first case of Schmallenberg (SBV) in northern Italy in February 2012, virus detection was conducted on midges collected during the national entomological surveillance program for bluetongue (BT). Six cattle farms, within a radius of 50. km from the SBV case, were selected for a 12 month study, aiming to determine when the virus entered the area, if it was capable of overwintering, and the possible role played by each species of the Obsoletus complex in disseminating the infection. A total of 33,724 Culicoides were collected at the six sites between June 2011 and June 2012. Species belonging to the Obsoletus Complex were the most abundant (94.44%) and, within the complex, Culicoides obsoletus was the most prevalent species in the studying area (65.4%).Nearly 7000 Culicoides midges were screened, either in pools or individually, for SBV by real-time RT-PCR. Viral genome was detected in six pools of the Obsoletus complex, collected at three sites between September and November 2011, and in a single parous female of C. obsoletus, collected in May 2012.As a result of the BT surveillance program in Italy it was possible to demonstrate, retrospectively, that SBV has circulated in at least three Italian provinces since early September 2011, nearly 5 months prior and as far as 40. km away from the first detected case. Similarly, the survey confirmed the presence of SBV in the vector population 3 months after the outbreak, following a cold winter during which the blacklight traps failed to catch active adult midges. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objectives: The present research has been performed to evaluate whether a commercial magnesium-enriched hydroxyapatite (MgHA)/collagen-based scaffold engineered with ovine amniotic fluid mesenchymal cells (oAFMC) could improve bone regeneration process in vivo. Materials and methods: Bilateral sinus augmentation was performed on eight adult sheep in order to compare the tissue regeneration process at 45 and 90 days after implantation of the oAFMC-engineered scaffold (Test Group) or of the scaffold alone (Ctr Group). The process of tissue remodeling was analyzed through histological, immunohistochemical, and morphometric analyses by calculating the proliferation index (PI) of oAFMC loaded on the scaffold, the total vascular area (VA), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression levels within the grafted area. Results: MgHA/collagen-based scaffold showed high biocompatibility preserving the survival of oAFMC for 90 days in grafted sinuses. The use of oAFMC increased bone deposition and stimulated a more rapid angiogenic reaction, thus probably supporting the higher cell PI recorded in cell-treated sinuses. A significantly higher VEGF expression (Test vs. Ctr Group; p = 0.0004) and a larger total VA (p = 0.0006) were detected in the Test Group at 45 days after surgery. The PI was significantly higher (p = 0.027) at 45 days and became significantly lower at 90 days (p = 0.0007) in the Test Group sinuses, while the PI recorded in the Ctr Group continued to increase resulting to a significantly higher PI at day 90 (CTR day 45 vs. CTR day 90; p = 0.022). Conclusions: The osteoinductive effect of a biomimetic commercial scaffold may be significantly improved by the presence of oAFMC. Clinical relevance: The amniotic fluid mesenchymal cell (AFMC) may represent a novel, largely and easily accessible source of mesenchymal stem cells to develop cell-based therapy for maxillofacial surgery. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={We modeled the ecological niche of a globally successful Bacillus anthracis sublineage in the United States, Italy and Kazakhstan to better understand the geographic distribution of anthrax and potential associations between regional populations and ecology. Country-specific ecological-niche models were developed and reciprocally transferred to the other countries to determine if pathogen presence could be accurately predicted on novel landscapes. Native models accurately predicted endemic areas within each country, but transferred models failed to predict known occurrences in the outside countries. While the effects of variable selection and limitations of the genetic data should be considered, results suggest differing ecological associations for the B. anthracis populations within each country and may reflect niche specialization within the sublineage. Our findings provide guidance for developing accurate ecological niche models for this pathogen; models should be developed regionally, on the native landscape, and with consideration to population genetics Further genomic analysis will improve our understanding of the genetic-ecological dynamics of B. anthracis across these countries and may lead to more refined predictive models for surveillance and proactive vaccination programs. Further studies should evaluate the impact of variable selection of native and transferred models. © 2013 Mullins et al.},

abstract={Since 2008, West Nile Virus (WNV) has expanded its range in several Italian regions, and its yearly recurrence suggests the virus may have become endemic in some areas. In 2011, a new plan based also on the detection of IgM antibodies was implemented in the north-eastern Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia, aiming to early detect WNV infections in areas where the virus had already circulated during the previous summers, and in adjacent zones. From July to November 2011, 1880 sera from 521 equine premises were screened by a commercial IgM capture ELISA. Mosquitoes were captured by CDC-CO 2 traps at 61 locations in the two regions. Collected mosquitoes were identified, pooled by species/date/location and examined by real-time RT-PCR and sequencing. Passive surveillance was carried out on clinically affected horses and non-migratory wild birds found dead. IgM sero-positive equines were detected in 19 holdings, five in the area with WNV circulation (AWC) and 14 in the surveillance area (SA); 10 more horse premises tested positive to further serological controls within 4km of the positive holdings. A total of 85398 mosquitoes of 15 species were collected and 2732 pools examined. Five Culex pipiens pools tested positive for the presence of WNV. Passive surveillance on non-migratory wild birds allowed detection of the virus only in one found dead collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto), of 82 birds sampled. The WNV belonged to the lineage 2, which had been isolated for the first time in Italy earlier in 2011. By the first week of October, nine human cases had been confirmed in the same area. The implementation of a protocol combining IgM screening of horses with surveillance on mosquito vectors proved to be valuable for early detecting WNV circulation. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2) causes sheep-associated malignant catarrhal fever (SA-MCF), and is responsible for economic losses in cattle and other susceptible species around the world. A survey of 154 serum samples from 14 flocks in 3 Japanese prefectures (Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate) was undertaken between 2007 and 2008 to test for antibodies to OvHV-2. OvHV-2 was present in 56 sheep and 2 goats, with 37.66% of samples having a positive reaction using a serum neutralization test. The immune reaction reported in goats could result from Caprine herpesvirus-2. These results indicate that sheep are reservoirs for OvHV-2 in the field in Japan, and they might transmit the virus to susceptible cattle and wild fauna. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.},

abstract={Following the first report of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in the brain of a dystocic goat foetus in 2012 in Northern Italy, immediate response actions were adopted to avoid the virus circulation. The brain tested positive by 2 different one-step real-time RT-PCR protocols; these results were also confirmed by partial sequencing of the viral genome. At that time this was the first detection of the new Orthobunyavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family in Italy. An epidemiological investigation in the involved farm was carried out in collaboration with the CESME - National Reference Centre for the study and verification of Foreign Animal Diseases (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise 'G. Caporale', Italy). Epidemiological information on the flock was provided and analysed, whole blood and serum samples were also collected from all animals in the farm for both virological and serological investigations. All blood samples tested negative for SBV, whereas serological positive results were obtained by virus-neutralization (VN). Epidemiological investigations indicated the possible virus circulation in the area. The subsequent surveillance actions were mainly based on the standardization and re-enforcement of passive surveillance protocols, a risk-based serological surveillance programme through VN and an entomological surveillance programme in the involved geographical areas were also put in place. Eventually SBV local circulation was confirmed by real time RT-PCR in 6 Culicoides pools, collected between September and November 2011 in 3 farms in the surroundings of the area of SBV outbreak.},

abstract={The development of early warning systems is fundamental for preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Data collection, however, is a costly activity and it is not possible to implement early warning systems everywhere and for all possible events. Hence, tools helping to improve the focus of surveillance efforts are of paramount importance. Risk assessment methods and other provisional modelling techniques may permit to estimate the probability of introduction and spread of infectious diseases in different geographical areas. Similarly, efficient information systems must be in place to assist the veterinary services in case of epidemic emergencies in order to support the prompt application of control measures for the containment of the infection and the reduction of the magnitude of negative consequences. This review describes two recent approaches to the estimation of the probability of introduction and spread of infectious diseases based on the use of risk maps/spatial modelling and Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques. The review also describes a web application developed in Italy to help official veterinary services to trace animals in case of outbreaks of infectious diseases.},

abstract={West Nile Virus lineage 1 (WNV lin1) emerged in North-Eastern Italy in 2008 and, since then, it has been detected in animals, humans and mosquitoes. Three years later, in the same area, a lineage 2 (lin2) strain of WNV was found in birds and vectors. On August the 21st, during the 2012 WNV entomological surveillance plan, a WNV lin2 strain was detected by RT-PCR in a pool of Culex pipiens mosquitoes captured in Veneto region. According to the alignment of the partial sequences of the NS5 and NS3 genes, no differences between this Italian lineage 2 strain and the Nea Santa-Greece-2010 WNV isolate (Gr-10) were observed. Similarly to the Gr-10 strain, the putative NS3 aminoacid sequences of the Italian strain showed proline in position 249 instead of histidine (H249P). Although proline in position 249 has been suggested to increase the virulence of WNV strains, neither human nor veterinary cases associated to this strain have been reported in the region. A prompt mosquito disinfestation was organized to avoid the spread of this potential threatening virus. The simultaneous circulation of both WNV lineage 1 and 2 confirms North-Eastern Italy as a high risk area for WNV emergence and highlights the need for a continuous surveillance.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) is one of the most serious public health threats that Europe and the Mediterranean countries are currently facing. In Italy, WNV emerged in 1998 and has been circulating since 2008. To tackle its continuous incursions, Italian national and regional institutions set up a surveillance program, which includes the serological screening of sentinel horses, sentinel-chickens and backyard poultry flocks and the surveillance on all equine neurological cases, resident captured and wild dead birds, and vectors. This communication aims to assess the importance of the entomological surveillance program as an early warning system for WNV circulation. In the province of Modena, the circulation of WNV lineage 2 strains was first detected in pools of Culex pipiens on July the 3 rd , 42 days prior to the onset of the first 2013 human WNV neuroinvasive case reported in the same province. Similarly in Veneto, WNV was first detected on July 3 rd in a pool of Cx. pipiens collected in the province of Venezia. The first human neuroinvasive case in this region occurred in the Rovigo province on July the 24 th , seven days after the detection of WNV lineage 2 in a mosquito pool collected in the same province. Up to the end of July 2013, WNV circulation was further detected in several other pools of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes collected in Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardia. According to the NS3 partial sequence alignments including all recent European and Italian Lineage 2 strains, the new circulating WNV lineage 2 strains share high nt homology with the Hungarian and with the previous lineage 2 strains isolated in Veneto and Sardegna in 2011 and 2012. These data provide a clear and practical demonstration of the relevance of a reliable entomological surveillance program to early detect WNV in Italy.},

abstract={West Nile disease (WND) is one of the most widespread mosquito-borne infectious diseases in the World. In Morocco the first WND cases were reported in equines in 1996. After an apparent epidemiological silence, WND re-occurred in 2003 and in 2010, when the disease was reported in equines living in the central and north-western part of the country. Eco-climatic variables are known to influence the mosquito presence and abundance and, therefore, the probability of occurrence of mosquito-borne infections. The remote sensed values of Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall registered from 2001 to 2010 were evaluated for a possible association with the occurrence of WND cases in 2003 and in 2010. In the zones where WND cases occurred, NDVI values recorded in 2003 and 2010, from June to November, were significantly higher than those registered during the same months in the rest of the decade. Rainfall data showed higher peaks in 2003 and 2010, when the number of days with extreme rainfall was significantly higher during 1-2 months before the occurrence of WND cases. Temperature does not seem to play an important role in Moroccan epidemiological conditions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In 2011, Trypanosoma equiperdum reemerged in Italy, almost 10 years after its last appearance. A total of eight infected horses have been observed to date. Six horses were affected by natural outbreaks of the disease, whereas two were infected experimentally. The aim of this study was to offer a recent perspective on clinical cases of dourine in Europe. Investigation of the clinical aspects confirmed the three stages reported in the literature: stage 1 (genital lesions), stage 2 (cutaneous signs), and stage 3 (nervous signs). The most common signs in the horses under study were notable weight loss, edematous skin eruptions and oedemas of the abdomen, mammary glands and hind legs. Three animals presented neurological signs (lip ptosis of lower lip and ataxia). Infections were paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic in some animals. Hyperthermia was not reported in infected animals and considerable anemia was observed. High antibody titers did not always correspond to clinical signs. Positive polymerase chain reaction test results of blood or tissue (skin, eye swab) often correspond to an advanced stage of the disease. Dourine is a variable disease; owing to its low prevalence and chronic manifestation, it can be difficult to make a quick diagnosis when facing a Dourine-positive horse. © 2013.},

abstract={The risks associated with zoonotic infections transmitted by companion animals are a serious public health concern: the control of zoonoses incidence in domestic dogs, both owned and stray, is hence important to protect human health. Integrated dog population management (DPM) programs, based on the availability of information systems providing reliable data on the structure and composition of the existing dog population in a given area, are fundamental for making realistic plans for any disease surveillance and action system. Traceability systems, based on the compulsory electronic identification of dogs and their registration in a computerised database, are one of the most effective ways to ensure the usefulness of DPM programs. Even if this approach provides many advantages, several areas of improvement have emerged in countries where it has been applied. In Italy, every region hosts its own dog register but these are not compatible with one another. This paper shows the advantages of a web-based-application to improve data management of dog regional registers. The approach used for building this system was inspired by farm animal traceability schemes and it relies on a network of services that allows multi-channel access by different devices and data exchange via the web with other existing applications, without changing the pre-existing platforms. Today the system manages a database for over 300,000 dogs registered in three different Italian regions. By integrating multiple Web Services, this approach could be the solution to gather data at national and international levels at reasonable cost and creating a traceability system on a large scale and across borders that can be used for disease surveillance and development of population management plans. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

This investigation was conducted in Sirajganj district in December 2010, on eight farms where animal cases had occurred. Bacillus anthracis was recovered from soil samples and turbinate bones on six farms. Canonical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis showed that all the isolates belonged to the major lineage A, sublineage A.Br.001/002 of China and South East Asia while a multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) with 15 VNTRs demonstrated three unique genotypes. The single nucleotide repeat (SNR) analyses showed two SNR types in 97 out of 99 isolates; nevertheless, due to its higher discriminatory power the presence of two isolates with different SNR-type polymorphisms were detected within two MLVA genotypes. The epidemic occurred during the monsoon season, a time of extensive flooding, suggesting that the source was contaminated feed, not grazing, which is supported by the genetic variance. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Bluetongue (BT) is a commonly cited example of a disease with a distribution believed to have recently expanded in response to global warming. The BT virus is transmitted to ruminants by biting midges of the genus Culicoides, and it has been hypothesized that the emergence of BT in Mediterranean Europe during the last two decades is a consequence of the recent colonization of the region by Culicoides imicola and linked to climate change. To better understand the mechanism responsible for the northward spread of BT, we tested the hypothesis of a recent colonization of Italy by C. imicola, by obtaining samples from more than 60 localities across Italy, Corsica, Southern France, and Northern Africa (the hypothesized source point for the recent invasion of C. imicola), and by genotyping them with 10 newly identified microsatellite loci. The patterns of genetic variation within and among the sampled populations were characterized and used in a rigorous approximate Bayesian computation framework to compare three competing historical hypotheses related to the arrival and establishment of C. imicola in Italy. The hypothesis of an ancient presence of the insect vector was strongly favoured by this analysis, with an associated P ≥ 99%, suggesting that causes other than the northward range expansion of C. imicola may have supported the emergence of BT in southern Europe. Overall, this study illustrates the potential of molecular genetic markers for exploring the assumed link between climate change and the spread of diseases. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenylether (PBDE-47) on the Chamelea gallina clam (according to current commercial regulations: Venus gallina). PBDEs, which are used as flame retardants in various industrial products, are classed as hazardous substances by Directive 2011/65/EU. They are bioaccumulative compounds, considered to be endocrine disruptors, genotoxic, neurotoxic and practically ubiquitous, and their concentration in the environment has considerably increased in recent years. The aim of this study is to establish the effects of PBDE-47 on Chamelea gallina: Toxic power and any harmful effects on the gonads, bioaccumulation capacity in the tissues, and possible entry into the food chain. The research used 96-hour and 21-day experimental tests on clams housed in filtered seawater. The tests were preceded by a period of acclimatisation of the molluscs lasting five to seven days. The clams were fed on seaweed (Dunaliella tertiolecta). The choice of the toxic compound PBDE-47 was based on the high concentration, among the congeners of PBDE, found in some aquatic species. The study demonstrated that the concentration of the contaminant used did not alter the vital functions, cause significant levels of mortality or lead to evident alteration in the gonads of Chamelea gallina. However, the research demonstrated the bioaccumulation capacity of the bivalve mollusc, allowing PBDE-47 to enter the food chain.},

abstract={African horse sickness (AHS) is a non-contagious viral disease of solipeds transmitted by Culicoides. The disease is endemic in most African countries. Past experience has shown that Italy is a country exposed to emerging infectious diseases endemic to Africa; an incursion of AHS virus together with the widespread presence of Culicoides vectors could be the cause of a serious epidemic emergency. A live attenuated vaccine containing seven of the nine viral serotypes, serotype 5 and 9 are excluded, is commercially available from Onderstepoort Biological Products. However, the use of live vaccines is a matter of endless disputes, and therefore inactivated or recombinant alternative products have been investigated over the years. Since research on AHS is hampered by the use of horses to evaluate vaccine potency, in a previous experiment serological response to serotypes 5 and 9 was assayed in guinea-pigs and horses. A durable and comparable serological response was observed in the two animal species. In the present study antibody response in horses and guinea-pigs, immunised with the inactivated-adjuvanted vaccine formulated with serotype 9, was tested over a period of 12 months. When immunity was challenged, horses were protected from infection and disease. Antibody response in horses and guinea-pigs compared favourably.},

abstract={Although avian influenza (AI) virus of H5 and H7 subtypes has the potential to mutate to a highly pathogenic form and cause very high mortalities in some poultry species, most AI infections in poultry are due to low pathogenic AI (LPAI). Hence serological surveys, coupled with passive surveillance activities, are essential to detect sub-clinical infections by LPAI viruses, H5 and H7 subtypes. However the proper planning of an active surveillance system should be based on a careful estimation of its performance. Therefore, the sensitivity of the active surveillance system for AI in the western region of Cuba was assessed by a stochastic model quantifying the probability of revealing at least one animal infected by H5 or H7 subtype. The diagnostic sensitivity of the haemagglutination inhibition assay and different levels of within-flock prevalence (5%, 12% and 30%) were considered. The sensitivity of the surveillance system was then assessed under five different samples size scenarios: testing 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 animals in each flock. Poultry flock sites in the western region of Cuba with a size ranging from 10,000 to 335,000 birds were included in the study.},

abstract={In Italy, National Law (281/1991) prohibits euthanasia of shelter dogs if they are not dangerous or suffering seriously. Adoption rates in rescue shelters are often lower than entrance rates, leading inevitably to overcrowded facilities where animals are likely to spend the rest of their lives in kennels. In this situation, housing conditions (i.e. space provided, environmental, and social stimulation) may have an impact on canine welfare. In this research project, the effects of two different forms of housing (group- and pair housing) on long-term shelter dogs were compared using behavioural and physiological parameters. Observational data and saliva samples were collected from dogs exposed to both experimental settings; behaviour and cortisol concentration levels were used as welfare indicators. Pair housing offered fewer social and environmental stimuli and behavioural analysis showed a significant decrease in locomotor, exploratory, and social behaviour. Cortisol levels show that this parameter varied independently of housing conditions. Although this study found no evidence suggesting that one form of confinement reduced animal welfare more than the other (e.g. in terms of abnormal behaviour, or higher cortisol concentrations), the type of confinement did affect the expression of a variety of behaviours and these variations should not be ignored with respect to housing decisions for long-term shelter dogs.},

abstract={Crayfish plague, caused by the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, is a serious disease of European freshwater crayfish and has eliminated entire populations in several European countries. In September 2011, mortality was observed among the Austropotamobius pallipes population of a river basin in the Abruzzi region (central Italy), and A. astaci DNA was detected by PCR in dead crayfish. A systematic survey was carried out to evaluate the spread and the effects of the plague in the river basin. The source of the outbreak remained unknown since North American crayfish species, which frequently act as subclinical carriers of the infection, were not detected in the area. The A. pallipes population disappeared from a river stretch of ~1 km, where A. astaci infection was detected in dead crayfish. However, apparently unaffected crayfish were still present upstream of that area as well as in a tributary that joined the brook in the apparently depopulated stretch. A. astaci infection was not detected in dead individuals collected in the upstream area and tributary. A follow-up visit conducted in the following season showed the presence of A. pallipes in the river stretch hit by the plague. In this outbreak, the spread of the infection could have been limited by a low density of the crayfish population and by the geographic conformation of the river basin, which includes a dense network of small tributaries, characterized by high flow velocity and low water temperature. In this particular setting, crayfish plague outbreaks can remain undetected. This underlines the importance of active monitoring programs aimed at the prompt recognition of both episodes of mortality and the presence of non-indigenous crayfish species. © Inter-Research 2013.},

abstract={Azaspiracid-1 (AZA-1) inhibits endocytosis, but the consequences of this alteration on cellular processes are unknown. We hypothesized that the inhibition of endocytosis is a key step of the mode of action of AZA-1, leading to perturbation of cellular processes dependent on proper functioning of endocytic machinery. We tested this working hypothesis by probing whether AZA-1 can alter the maturation of cathepsin D in MCF-7 epithelial cells, as a model system. We found that cell treatment with AZA-1 inhibited the conversion of 52 kDa procathepsin D into the mature 30 kDa protein. The effects induced by AZA-1 were similar to those elicited by chlorpromazine and other agents preventing proper maturation of lysosomal enzymes, indicating that the inhibition of endocytic transfer of proforms to late endosomes/lysosomess is responsible for the effect induced by the toxin. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we found no colocalization of cathepsin D and the early endosomal marker EEA-1 in control cells, where most of cathepsin D resides in late endosomes/lysosomes. Co-localization of cathepsin D and EEA-1 immunoreactivity, in turn, was found in cells exposed to AZA-1, indicating that the toxin blocks protein maturation at the early steps of endocytosis, causing accumulation of procathepsin D in early endosomes. The molecular alteration induced by AZA-1 involved both secreted and intracellular pools of procathepsin D, showing that the toxin effect does not result from a general impairment of vesicular trafficking but is the outcome of a perturbed centripetal process. Furthermore, AZA-1 was found to inhibit procathepsin D maturation also in normal fibroblasts, showing that this molecular response is induced by this toxin in different cell types. The data we obtained corroborated our hypothesis and provide a unified molecular frame for the mode of action of AZAs in animal models, involving a primary alteration of endocytic processes. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Diagnosis and control of dourine is strongly based on serological evidence, but knowledge of the humoral response of horses during infection is limited. In this study we developed a chemiluminescent immunoblotting (cIB) assay to characterise the Trypanosoma equiperdum antigen pattern recognised by IgGs from naturally or experimentally dourine-infected horses and analyse the kinetics of IgG humoral response following the infection. One compounding factor is that sera from uninfected animals often cross-react with T. equiperdum antigens. Development of the cIB assay was based on the hypothesis that serum IgGs from healthy and infected animals recognise different T. equiperdum antigen patterns. We used sera from 8 naturally infected horses which had recovered from Italian outbreaks and 2 experimentally infected mares. In addition, sera from 10 healthy control animals, eight of which were CFT positive but IFA negative for dourine, were collected from disease free regions. Sera were compared by the complement fixation test (CFT), indirect immune fluorescence (IFA) and the cIB assay.cIB analysis revealed that IgGs from infected horses, in contrast to IgGs from healhty horses, specifically recognise a T. equiperdum antigenic profile with low molecular weight bands ranging between 16 and 35. kDa. A time course experiment indicated that IgGs specific for the 16-35. kDa parasite protein fraction appear 17 days post-infection. The cIB assay confirmed all ten infected animals as positive and all controls as negative. This study demonstrated that analysis of IgGs by cIB can provide clear confirmation of trypanosome infection in horses, suggesting that this technique can be applied as a confirmatory serological test for dourine infection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Clinical diagnosis of dourine can be complex, as clinical signs and gross lesions are not always present. Direct laboratory diagnosis is also problematic, given the low number of parasites normally present in infected tissues and the mild, short-lasting parasitaemia.

abstract={Study Question Is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) dysfunction involved in epigenetic deregulation of placentae from embryos obtained by assisted reproduction technologies (ARTs)? Summary Answer DNMT1 expression in growing placentae of in vitro produced (IVP) embryos is compromised and associated with pregnancy loss. What is Known AlreadyDNMT1 maintains the methylation profile of genes during cell division. The methylation status of genes involved in placenta development is altered in embryos obtained in vitro. Disturbances in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during placentogenesis could be involved in the frequent developmental arrest and loss of IVP embryos. Study Design , Size, DurationForty sheep were naturally mated (Group 1, CTR). IVP blastocysts (2-4 per ewe) were surgically transferred to the remaining 46 recipient sheep 6 days after oestrus (Group 2). Twenty-one recipients from Group 1 and 27 recipients from Group 2 were allowed to deliver in order to compare embryo survival in both groups at term (150 days). From the remaining recipients (n = 38), fetuses and placentae of both groups were recovered by paramedian laparotomy at Days 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28 of gestation. Materials, Setting, Method SImmediately after collection, early placental tissues (chorion-allantois) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and DNMT1 expression and activity was evaluated. mRNA levels (for DNMT1, HDAC2, PCNA, DMAP1, MEST, IGF2, CDKN1C, H19) and the methylation status of H19 were also analyzed. Furthermore, embryo size and survival rate were measured. Main Results and the Role of Chance Our study shows that DNMT1 expression was reduced in early placentae from sheep IVP embryos. This reduction was associated with growth arrest and subsequent death of the sheep embryos. Conversely, normal levels of DNMT1 and its cofactors were observed in placentae from IVP embryos that survived this developmental bottleneck. Although DNA methylation machinery was severely compromised in IVP placentae only up to Day 24, the low DNMT1 enzymatic activity that persisted after this stage in IVP placentae was not lethal for the developing embryos. Limitations, Reasons for Caution The studied genes represent only a small fraction of genes regulating DNA methylation. Further studies are needed to evaluate changes in the expression and methylation status of other genes that may lead to developmental arrest of IVP embryos. As this is the only study evaluating the functionality of DNMT1 machinery in placentae from ART embryos, studies on other species are needed to confirm if our observation may be applicable to all mammalian embryos produced in vitro. Wider Implications of the FindingsThe knowledge about compromised activity of DNMT1 in placentae obtained from IVP embryos should stimulate detailed studies on the metabolic requirements of oocytes and embryos in order to adequately enrich the culture media.

abstract={In order to get a reliable estimate of brucellosis prevalence in Eritrean dairy cattle, a cross-sectional study was carried out in 2009. The survey considered the sub-population of dairy cattle reared in modern small- and medium-sized farms. Samples were screened with the Rose Bengal test (RBT) and positive cases were confirmed with the complement fixation test (CFT). A total of 2.77% (417/15 049; Credibility Interval CI: 2.52% - 3.05%) of the animals tested in this study were positive for antibodies to Brucella species, with a variable and generally low distribution of positive animals at regional level. The highest seroprevalence was found in the Maekel region (5.15%; CI: 4.58% - 5.80%), followed by the Debub (1.99%; CI: 1.59% - 2.50%) and Gash-Barka (1.71%; CI: 1.34% - 2.20%) regions. Seroprevalence at sub-regional levels was also generally low, except for two sub-regions of Debub and the sub-region Haicota from the Gash-Barka region. Seroprevalence was high and more uniformly distributed in the Maekel region, namely in the Asmara, Berik and Serejeka sub-regions. Considering the overall low brucellosis prevalence in the country, as identified by the present study, a brucellosis eradication programme for dairy farms using a test-and-slaughter policy would be possible. However, to encourage the voluntary participation of farmers to the programme and to raise their awareness of the risks related to the disease for animals and humans, an extensive public awareness campaign should be carefully considered, as well as strict and mandatory dairy movement control. © 2013.

abstract={Culicoides imicola is considered to be one of the main vectors of bluetongue disease in the Mediterranean Basin. However, local variations occur. For example, in Italy, C. imicola is a stable and abundant population in Sardinia and is widely distributed across the island, whilst in Tuscany on the Italian mainland, it ranges from low abundance in the west and coastal areas to absence in the eastern part of the region. Entomological surveillance data collected over 10 years were used to classify 52 sites as low to medium or high C. imicola abundance in Sardinia, and 59 sites as either positive or negative in Tuscany. The land cover was mapped from high-resolution remote sensing images using an object-based image analysis approach and a set of landscape metrics with 500 m buffers around each site. Multivariate analysis was used to test the statistical association of landscape metrics to C. imicola presence and abundance together with other eco-climatic and topographic variables. In Sardinia, 75% of the sites were correctly classified based on altitude alone and the inclusion of landscape-related variables did not improve the classification. In Tuscany, the mean annual temperature allowed classifying 70% of the positive/negative sites correctly. When landscape metrics was included in the multivariate model, an improvement up to 80% was obtained. The presence of riparian vegetation and water was found to be positively correlated with C. imicola presence, whilst forest (including the edge between the forest and cultivated areas) was found to be negatively related to the presence of C. imicola.},

abstract={Understanding the factors governing host species barriers to virus transmission has added significantly to our appreciation of virus pathogenesis. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA), a transmissible lung cancer of sheep that has rarely been found in goats. In this study, in order to further clarify the pathogenesis of OPA, we investigated whether goats are resistant to JSRV replication and carcinogenesis. We found that JSRV induces lung tumors in goats with macroscopic and histopathological features that dramatically differ from those in sheep. However, the origins of the tumor cells in the two species are identical. Interestingly, in experimentally infected lambs and goat kids, we revealed major differences in the number of virus-infected cells at early stages of infection. These differences were not related to the number of available target cells for virus infection and cell transformation or the presence of a host-specific immune response toward JSRV. Indeed, we also found that goats possess transcriptionally active endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) that likely influence the host immune response toward the exogenous JSRV. Overall, these results suggest that goat cells, or at least those cells targeted for viral carcinogenesis, are not permissive to virus replication but can be transformed by JSRV. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={We compiled information on the distribution of ticks in the western Palearctic (11°W, 45°E; 29°N, 71°N), published during 1970-2010. The literature search was filtered by the tick's species name and an unambiguous reference to the point of capture. Records from some curated collections were included. We focused on tick species of importance to human and animal health, in particular: Ixodes ricinus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. reticulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, H. sulcata, Hyalomma marginatum, Hy. lusitanicum, Rhipicephalus annulatus, R. bursa, and the R. sanguineus group. A few records of other species (I. canisuga, I. hexagonus, Hy. impeltatum, Hy. anatolicum, Hy. excavatum, Hy. scupense) were also included. A total of 10,280 records was included in the data set. Almost 42 % of published references are not adequately referenced (and not included in the data set), host is reported for only 61 % of records and a reference to time of collection is missed for 84 % of published records. Ixodes ricinus accounted for 44. 3 % of total records, with H. marginatum and D. marginatus accounting for 7. 1 and 8. 1 % of records, respectively. The lack of homogeneity of the references and potential pitfalls in the compilation were addressed to create a digital data set of the records of the ticks. We attached to every record a coherent set of quantitative descriptors for the site of reporting, namely gridded interpolated monthly climate and remotely sensed data on vegetation (NDVI). We also attached categorical descriptors of the habitat: a standard classification of land biomes and an ad hoc classification of the target territory from remotely sensed temperature and NDVI data. A descriptive analysis of the data revealed that a principal components reduction of the environmental (temperature and NDVI) variables described the distribution of the species in the target territory. However, categorical descriptors of the habitat were less effective. We stressed the importance of building reliable collections of ticks with specific references as to collection point, host and date of capture.

abstract={Free trade of animals and their products is based on the international or bilateral recognition of the health status of the animal populations being traded. This recognition is based on documentation of their health status by the exporting country, based on the results of continuing surveillance. According to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), this may be based on various methods of surveillance, such as: documenting non-specific surveillance (clinical surveillance, passive notification of suspect cases, etc.); documenting activities that increase the sensitivity of non-specific surveillance (training activities, rewards/sanctions for notification/failure to notify, etc.); documenting all specific surveillance and its results (random surveys, targeted and risk-based surveillance, conveniencetesting activities, etc.). Usually, the infection is the subject of the declaration of freedom. While clinical and passive surveillance can provide a high level of confidence that foot and mouth disease (FMD) infection is absent, this is not the case in vaccinated populations. In these populations, specific surveillance becomes much more important than non-specific clinical surveillance. Specific surveillance is severely restricted by the performance of the test(s) employed. The imperfect specificity of any serological test is further complicated when techniques to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) are used, because imperfect purification of the antigen used for vaccination may foster the production of undesired antibodies in the vaccinated animals. The authors discuss various approaches to overcome this problem; their merits and flaws in documenting the absence of infection or virus circulation for animal diseases in general, and for FMD in particular. Particular attention is paid to finding methods that can be applied in a variety of epidemiological conditions and organisational structures, since these vary greatly among OIE Members.},

abstract={Background: West Nile Virus (WNV) is a flavivirus that requires an efficient humoral and cellular host response for the control of neuroinvasive infection. We previously reported the existence of six alternative open reading frame proteins in WNV genome, one of which entitled WARF4 is exclusively restricted to the lineage I of the virus. WARF4 is able to elicit antibodies in WNV infected horses; however, there was no direct experimental proof of the existence of this novel protein. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the in vitro production of WARF4 protein following WNV infection of cultured VERO cells and its immunity in WNV infected individuals. Results: We produced a monoclonal antibody against WARF4 protein (MAb 3A12) which detected the novel protein in WNV lineage I-infected, cultured VERO cells while it did not react with WNV lineage II infected cells. MAb 3A12 specificity to WARF4 protein was confirmed by its reactivity to only one peptide among four analyzed that cover the full WARF4 amino acids sequence. In addition, WARF4 protein was expressed in the late phase of WNV lineage I infection. Western blotting and bioinformatics analyses strongly suggest that the protein could be translated by programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting process. Since WARF4 is embedded in the NS4B gene, we rename this novel protein N-NS4B/WARF4. Furthermore, serological analysis shows that N-NS4B/WARF4 is able to elicit antibodies in WNV infected individuals. Conclusions: N-NS4B/WARF4 is the second Alternative Reading Frame (ARF) protein that has been demonstrated to be produced following WNV infection and might represent a novel tool for a better characterization of immune response in WNV infected individuals. Further serological as well as functional studies are required to characterize the function of the N-NS4B/WARF4 protein. Since the virus might actually make an extensive use of ARFs, it appears important to investigate the novel six ARF putative proteins of WNV. © 2012 Faggioni et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Culicoides imicola KEFFER, 1913 (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is the principal vector of Bluetongue disease in the Mediterranean basin, Africa and Asia. Previous studies have identified a range of eco-climatic variables associated with the distribution of C. imicola, and these relationships have been used to predict the arge-scale distribution of the vector. However, these studies are not temporally-explicit and can not be used to predict the seasonality in C. imicola abundances. Between 2001 and 2006, longitudinal entomological surveillance was carried out throughout Italy, and provided a comprehensive spatio-temporal dataset of C. imicola catches in Onderstepoort-type black-light traps, in particular in Sardinia where the species is considered endemic. Methods: We built a dynamic model that allows describing the effect of eco-climatic indicators on the monthly abundances of C. imicola in Sardinia. Model precision and accuracy were evaluated according to the influence of process and observation errors. Results: A first-order autoregressive cofactor, a digital elevation model and MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST)/or temperatures acquired from weather stations explained ∼77% of the variability encountered in the samplings carried out in 9 sites during 6 years. Incorporating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or rainfall did not increase the model's predictive capacity. On average, dynamics simulations showed good accuracy (predicted vs. observed r corr = 0.9). Although the model did not always reproduce the absolute levels of monthly abundances peaks, it succeeded in reproducing the seasonality in population level and allowed identifying the periods of low abundances and with no apparent activity. On that basis, we mapped C. imicola monthly distribution over the entire Sardinian region. Conclusions: This study demonstrated prospects for modelling data arising from Culicoides longitudina entomological surveillance. The framework explicitly incorporates the influence of eco-climatic factors on population growth rates and accounts for observation and process errors. Upon validation, such a model could be used to predict monthly population abundances on the basis of environmental conditions, and hence can potentially reduce the amount of entomological surveillance. © 2012 Rigot et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The spatial propagation of many livestock infectious diseases critically depends on the animal movements among premises; so the knowledge of movement data may help us to detect, manage and control an outbreak. The identification of robust spreading features of the system is however hampered by the temporal dimension characterizing population interactions through movements. Traditional centrality measures do not provide relevant information as results strongly fluctuate in time and outbreak properties heavily depend on geotemporal initial conditions. By focusing on the case study of cattle displacements in Italy, we aim at characterizing livestock epidemics in terms of robust features useful for planning and control, to deal with temporal fluctuations, sensitivity to initial conditions and missing information during an outbreak. Through spatial disease simulations, we detect spreading paths that are stable across different initial conditions, allowing the clustering of the seeds and reducing the epidemic variability. Paths also allow us to identify premises, called sentinels, having a large probability of being infected and providing critical information on the outbreak origin, as encoded in the clusters. This novel procedure provides a general framework that can be applied to specific diseases, for aiding risk assessment analysis and informing the design of optimal surveillance systems. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

Sequences to genes of interest were collected in FASTA format from NCBI. The collected sequences were processed with OligoPicker software. Oligonucleotides were then checked for their selectivity with BLAST searches in GenBank. The microarray was tested with ATCC/NCTC strains of Mycoplasma spp. of veterinary importance in ruminants including Mycoplasma belonging to the mycoides cluster as well as Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri field strains. The results showed that but one ATCC/NCTC reference strains hybridized with their species-specific sequences showed a profile/signature different and distinct from each other. The heat-map of the hybridization results for the nine genes interrogated for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides demonstrated that the reference strain Mycoplasma mycoides subsp mycoides PG1 was positive for all of the gene sequences spotted on the microarray. CBPP field, vaccine and reference strains were all typed to be M. mycoides subsp. mycoides, and seven of the nine strains gave positive hybridization results for all of the nine genes. Two Italian strains were negative for some of the genes. Comparison with non-Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides reference strains showed some positive signals or considerable homology to Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides genes. As expected, some correlations were observed between the strictly genetically and antigenically correlated Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides and Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri strains. Specifically, we observed that some Italian Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides strains were positive for two out of the three Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri genes, differently from what has been observed for other European or African Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides strains. This study highlighted the use of microarray technology as a simple and effective method for a singlEstep identification and differentiation of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides from other mycoplasmas that may be pathogenic to ruminants, including those of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster, genetically and antigenically strictly correlated with Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides. The opportunity to discriminate several mycoplasmas in a single analysis enhances diagnostic rapidity and may represent a useful tool to screen occasionally mycoplasmas affecting animal farming in territories where diagnostic laboratory support is limited. The heat-map of the hybridization results of the comparative genomic hybridizations DNA-designed chip clearly indicates that the microarray performs well for the identification of the tested Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides reference and field strains, discriminating them from other mycoplasmas. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

abstract={A female wild boar, aged approximately two years, was found dead by local veterinary services in Pianola di Roio in L'Aquila Province situated in the Abruzzo Region of central Italy. The carcass was submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise 'G. Caporale' in Teramo for necropsy. Brucella suis biovar 2 was isolated from submandibular lymph nodes. This is the first report of isolation of B. suis in the Abruzzo Region. Several authors agreed in the past on the hypothesis that B. suis biovar 2 had been introduced into Italy through the importation of hares from European countries in which the infection is endemic in wild populations. This lead the Italian authorities to reinforce existing controls for hares imported for restocking purposes. However, no provisions for brucellosis control are currently in place (or have been in place in the past) for wild boar movements either at the national or the European level. The isolation of B. suis biovar 2 from wild boar in two different and distant regions of Italy may suggest that this infection may have been introduced to the affected areas by wild boar rather than by imported hares. National and European rules managing wildlife brucellosis should be adapted to control the health status of farmed wild boar before movement or release, with the aim of preventing the spread of this pathogen to free territories. © Istituto G.

abstract={Migratory birds are considered one of the main sources for West Nile virus (WNV) introduction into European countries. Following the WNV epidemic in the late summer of 1998 in a marshy area of Tuscany (Padule of Fucecchio), an extensive ornithological surveillance programme was carried out in the infected areas from 2006 to 2008. Several species of migratory and resident birds were trapped, sampled and serologically tested. The results of this surveillance programme gave a useful indication of potential sources of WNV re-introduction and spread into Italy. The area under study was also investigated and classified into ecological areas through satellite image processing. In August 2008, the WNV infection re-emerged in Italy in the area surrounding the Po river delta, involving three regions: Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and Veneto. Several surveillance activities were immediately put in place, including the extensive monitoring of wild birds found dead or trapped in the framework of other surveillance programmes. These activities were also prolonged in the 2009, when the virus circulation re-occurred at the border of the area already infected in 2008. The possible epidemiological role of the different species of migratory and resident birds is discussed, in relation to the different ecological patterns identified in the area and their potential ability to introduce, spread and support the endemization of WNV infection. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

None of the sera tested were serologically positive to Brucella spp. A total of 21 animals (8.64%) out of 243 samples tested were seropositive to the C. burnetii antigen. Levels of infection were observed in all of the three Prefectures and in ten flocks of the fourteen sampled. Although no diagnostic measures were in place, the infection could not be linked to losses in sheep production or to the decreased fertility in ewes, a lower lambing rate and mortality in lambs. These data confirmed that Q fever is widespread in the sheep population in the area studied. Considering the zoonotic potential of the disease, further studies to investigate the epidemiology of Q fever in this region are required. © Istituto G. Caporale 2012.},

abstract={Aims: To provide an epidemiologic interpretation of a suspected outbreak of food poisoning caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Berta strains isolated from humans and from the leftovers of the implicated foods (cream, dairy-based desserts and eggs). Methods and Results: We have correlated the similarity between the strains through genotyping with Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), studying antimicrobial sensitivity patterns and epidemiological investigation. The clonal origin of the outbreak was confirmed by all laboratory tests. PFGE analysis of the restriction profiles obtained with XbaI and SpeI revealed a certainly correlation from the strains isolated from the various sources, while the antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was the same in all cases, with all strains sensitive to all antibiotics tested. Conclusions: Poor hygiene conditions in the facility concerned, lack of hygiene in food handling, high summer temperatures and positive cultures from asymptomatic staff could all be implicated in the infection, with food being the means through which it spread. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study describes the first outbreak of food poisoning caused by Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Berta (Salmonella Berta) reported in Italy. It confirms the importance of correlating epidemiological investigations with genotyping and phenotyping to understand the dynamics of infection. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={In order to estimate prevalence, levels and patterns of Listeria monocytogenes contamination, a total of 774 swine carcasses were traced along the Parma ham production chain. Analyses were conducted on isolates originated from the same carcass, collected at different stages during processing, resulting in 0.2% (faeces at intestine removal from carcasses), 3.0% (swabbing of carcasses), 12.5% (fresh hams) and 2.0% prevalence (dry-cured hams). The highest contamination levels of L. monocytogenes were reached in fresh hams after cutting and were followed by a marked decrease during the subsequent processing stages. All the 132 isolates were characterized by serotyping and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Transfer of L. monocytogenes between different stages of the processing chain was not reported, whereas processing itself has proved to be an important cause of contamination. The sole isolate of fecal origin belonged to a pulsotype that was uncommon to any of those recovered in carcasses, fresh hams and dry-cured hams, indicating that contaminations from farms does not significantly affect Parma ham production. For the majority of the strains isolated from the same production plants, PFGE profiles were highly similar. In several cases, the same pulsotypes were recurrently detected, over time, in carcasses and fresh ham samples sharing the same processing environment. A w levels were also measured, showing that drying of the ham surface was able to induce a considerable decrease of the contamination levels, although unable to ultimately remove L. monocytogenes. © 2011.},

abstract={A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA), an indirect ELISA (i-ELISA) and a dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescence immunoassay (DELFIA) were developed to test for antibodies to Brucella suis in pig and wild boar sera. An anti-Brucella-LPS monoclonal antibody (MAb 4B5A) (c-ELISA and DELFIA) and an anti-swine IgG monoclonal antibody (MAb 10C2G5) (i-ELISA) were used for the three assays. The specificity (Sp) and sensitivity (Se) of the assays gave the following results: Se and Sp = 100% at a cut-off value of 61.0% (B/B0%) for c-ELISA; Sp = 99.1% and Se = 100% at a cut-off value of 21.7% (percentage positivity: PP%) for i-ELISA; Sp = 91.0% and Se = 75% at a cut-off value of 37.0% (B/B0%) for DELFIA. In addition, the performance of a commercial fluorescence polarisation assay (FPA), standardised for bovine sera, was evaluated in swine sera. The specificity and sensitivity obtained were both 100% at a cut-off value of 99.5 (millipolarisation unit values). These results suggest that the combination of c-ELISA, i-ELISA and FPA can be used to improve the serological diagnosis of swine brucellosis.},

Being able to assess learning needs and to deliver training is acknowledged as a strategic priority in veterinary public health activities. The validation of an e-learning system that is able to respond to the urgent needs of veterinary professionals to ensure the despatch of rapid teaching methods on emerging and re-emerging animal diseases and zoonoses was the core of a research project developed in the Mediterranean Basin between 2005 and 2009. The project validated a new transferable, sustainable and repeatable learning model, the main components of which are described. The model is applied to an emergency situation that occurred in Italy in 2008, when West Nile disease outbreaks were reported in northern Italy. Approximately 450 official veterinarians were trained, using an e-learning system that showed adaptability and effectiveness in transferring knowledge, skills and competence to face the situation. The case was used to validate the effectiveness of the model and proved that it can be applied in any emergency situation, i.e. every time that rapid dissemination of knowledge and skills is required.},

Specific primers and probes were designed for each assay. 16S rRNA and cyt-b target genes located in the mitochondrial DNA were used for this purpose. The limit of detection of the Real-Time PCR methods ranged between 0.02 pg and 0.80 pg of template DNA, with an efficiency between 95% and 100%. All methods were able to detect the target species when spiked at 1% in any other species and no relevant difference was observed between the Ct values of raw and cooked samples. An Internal Amplification Control was used to detect possible false negatives due to inhibitory substances eventually present in the sample matrix. The assays were tested on meat mixtures to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={An atypical pestivirus ('Hobi'-like pestivirus, putative bovine viral diarrhoea 3, BVDV-3) was identified firstly in contaminated foetal calf serum batches and isolated subsequently from an outbreak of respiratory disease in a cattle herd in Italy. The isolation of the novel pestivirus from animals affected clinically posed concerns about the validity of BVDV eradication programs, considering that 'Hobi'-like pestivirus (BVDV-3) is undetected or mistyped by the molecular diagnostic tools currently employed. In this paper, the development of a nested PCR (nPCR) assay for unambiguous typing of all bovine pestiviruses is reported. The assay consisted of a first-round amplification using an oligonucleotide pair which binds to conserved sequences located in the 5' untranslated region and capsid gene, followed by a heminested PCR using virus-specific forward primers. The assay performances were evaluated analytically, showing good sensitivity and specificity. By analysis of 100 BVDV-positive samples typed using a nPCR assay discriminating ruminant pestiviruses, five samples recognised previously as BVDV-2 were not typed when submitted to the new assay (n= 2) or reacted as 'Hobi'-like pestivirus BVDV-3 (n= 3). Sequence analysis of the first-round amplification products showed that the untyped strains were border disease viruses, whereas the other three strains were true 'Hobi'-like viruses. The development of a molecular assay able to identify simultaneously all bovine pestiviruses known currently will help warrant biosafety of live vaccines and other biological products and assess the molecular epidemiology of 'Hobi'-like pestivirus, thus leading to the improvement of the eradication programs through unambiguous typing of pestiviruses infecting cattle. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={A total of 1259 raw milk samples were examined over a three-year period for various antibiotics chloramphenicol, penicillins, cephalosporines, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, beta-lactams, quinolones, aminoglycosides and macrolides. Microbiological and immunoassay methods used for determination of these antibiotics were validated according to the guidelines laid down by European Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. Microbiological screening detected 36 positive samples and in only one sample presence of residues was confirmed. Also, immunoassay determination found one positive sample on tetracycline residues. In total, 37 positive samples were determined, which was equal to a frequency of 0.69% of the total number of targeted analyses. The HPLC-DAD method confirmed the presence of residues above the maximum residue limits (MRLs) in two samples with concentrations of 12 μg kg-1 for penicillin G and 19 μg kg-1 for amoxicillin, and 1671 μg kg-1 for tetracycline. Calculated estimated daily intakes (EDIs) for antibiotics presented showed lower exposure levels than the fixed values of acceptable daily intakes (ADIs). These suggested that raw milk in Croatia contain very low levels of veterinary drugs so that toxicological risk with regard to consuming of milk could not be considered as a public health problem. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) requested an International Standard anti-Brucella melitensis Serum (ISaBmS) to standardise diagnostic tests and reagents for sheep and goats. The agreed criteria were the highest dilution (in negative serum) of the standard which must give a positive result and the lowest dilution (in negative serum) which must simultaneously give a negative result. The two dilutions for each assay were, respectively: indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) 1/64 and 1/750, competitive ELISA (cELISA) 1/8 and 1/300, fluorescent polarisation assay (FPA) 1/16 and 1/200, Rose Bengal test (RBT) 1/16 and 1/200. The OIE International Standard Serum (OIEISS) will remain the primary standard for the RBT; the ISaBmS is an additional standard. It was impossible to set criteria for the complement fixation test, therefore the OIEISS will remain the primary standard. The ISaBmS can be used to standardise iELISA, cELISA and FPA to diagnose sheep and goat brucellosis. This standard should facilitate harmonisation of tests used for brucellosis surveillance and international trade in these species.},

abstract={For the second consecutive year a West Nile disease (WND) epidemic has affected Italy causing disease in horses and humans. The infection re-occurred in the same places of the 2008 and moved westerly and southerly involving new areas and regions. The whole genome sequence of the Italian 2009 West Nile disease isolate (WNDV) was compared with those responsible for the 2008 WND outbreaks. The epidemiological findings of the two years of epidemic were compared as well. The high identity between 2008 and 2009 WNV strains (>99%), the earlier virus circulation in 2009 and the re-occurrence of the disease starting from the bordering infected areas reached by the infection in the previous year, strongly support the hypothesis of the overwintering of the virus and the endemisation to local host populations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, an analysis of the effects of the two different routes of infection on disease outcome is lacking. This study analyses the disease outcome in cattle infected by the two methodologies. Data originate from two controlled trials conducted in Namibia under field conditions. Intubation appears to be responsible for chronic evolution of the disease while in-contact infected animals develop more severe infection inducing mortality. Our results seem to suggest that the mode of infection may condition the disease outcome and should be taken into consideration in studies on the pathogenesis of CBPP. © Istituto G. Caporale 2011.},

abstract={Even though bluetongue virus (BTV) transmission is apparently interrupted during winter, bluetongue outbreaks often reappear in the next season (overwintering). Several mechanisms for BTV overwintering have been proposed, but to date, their relative importance remain unclear. In order to assess the probability of BTV overwintering by persistence in adult vectors, ruminants (through prolonged viraemia) or a combination of both, a quantitative risk assessment model was developed. Furthermore, the model allowed the role played by the residual number of vectors present during winter to be examined, and the effect of a proportion of Culicoides living inside buildings (endophilic behaviour) to be explored. The model was then applied to a real scenario: overwintering in Germany between 2006 and 2007. The results showed that the limited number of vectors active during winter seemed to allow the transmission of BTV during this period, and that while transmission was favoured by the endophilic behaviour of some Culicoides, its effect was limited. Even though transmission was possible, the likelihood of BTV overwintering by the mechanisms studied seemed too low to explain the observed re-emergence of the disease. Therefore, other overwintering mechanisms not considered in the model are likely to have played a significant role in BTV overwintering in Germany between 2006 and 2007. © 2011 Napp et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={This paper describes the national system for the notification and management of outbreaks of animal diseases in Italy (Sistema Informativo Nazionale Malattie Animali: SIMAN). The main objective of the system is to provide a tool for the management of epidemic emergencies and to fulfil the information obligations towards international organisations, such as the European Commission and World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Épizooties: OIE). SIMAN was thus designed to collect all relevant information on outbreaks of animal diseases and to provide a useful tool for the management of activities to be implemented in emergencies. SIMAN is able to collect and report information concerning suspected or confirmed animal outbreaks in a consistent way and allows veterinary services to enter data electronically, instead of using paperwork, within the framework of the process of e-government and dematerialisation of the administrative acts. Data are immediately accessible for local and national authorities. The system provides the relevant national authorities with information relative to the planning of control measures in case epidemic emergencies. SIMAN is part of the e-government process that involves all public administrations of the European Union (EU) and refers to the use of information and communication technologies for the digital processing of documents so as to simplify the system and to make administrative procedures on the Internet much easier to follow. © Istituto G.

Data on the geographical area, sex, and age were collected for statistical analysis of risk factors associated with infection. A seroprevalence of 8.5% was found: 8.2% of the animals were positive for anti-T. equi antibodies and 0.3% for anti-B. caballi antibodies. No dual infections were observed. Of those horses with positive serology to T. equi, 33% were also positive in PCR, whereas none of the seropositive horses for B. caballi was positive in PCR.

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) was detected in Italy, in late summer 2008 in horses and birds in the Po valley. As a consequence, an intense WNV surveillance was implemented in that area involving Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Lombardy. This paper presents the results of the September 2008-November 2009 surveillance on equines, mosquitoes, wild birds, dogs and cattle in Veneto. WNV was detected in equines and dogs, and, to a lesser extent in cattle and wild birds. Simultaneous circulation of Usutu virus was detected by testing wild birds found dead. Usutu virus but not WNV was also found in mosquitoes monitored during 2009. Equine practices monitoring allowed the definition of an area of WNV circulation and the 2008-2009 westward and northward spread of the infection. Although a relatively low number of human cases and a low virus circulation in vectors and birds detected in Veneto region could be considered favourable conditions for a limited risk of human exposure, it remains difficult to predict the possible evolution of the epidemiological situation.

The authors describe the freshwater classifications obtained through monitoring campaigns conducted over a period of twelve years (1996 to 2008). The results indicate slight improvements in the quality of the water over time in terms of contamination by chemicals for which they were monitored; however, 14 stretches do not comply with the requirements of the European Union Directive. © Istituto G.

abstract={An investigation was conducted to evaluate Staphylococcus aureus contamination in various types of food of animal origin. Of the 350 samples examined, 14.0% were found to be contaminated with S. aureus. Prevalence rates varied according to type, namely: 19.3% for fresh meat products, 13.3% for fresh cheeses, 3.6% for bakery products and 7.7% for deli products. The isolated S. aureus strains then underwent 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by reverse latex agglutination tests to identify enterotoxigenic strains. The results were compared with data obtained by subjecting the same strains to tests for the genes coding for the S. aureus enterotoxins (SEs) sea, seb, sec, sed, see, seg, seh, sei and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1). Reversed passive latex agglutination (RPLA) testing revealed that 16.3% of strains (8/49) produced enterotoxins, while on PCR, 48.97% (24/49) were found to carry one or more genes for the production of SEs, and were therefore potentially enterotoxigenic. © Istituto G.

abstract={A new real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for a simple and rapid diagnosis of African Horse Sickness (AHS) was developed. Primers and FAM-labeled TaqMan-MGB probes specific for African horse sickness virus (AHSV) were selected from the consensus sequence of the segment 8 of all 9 serotypes of AHSV reference strains. For the determination of the analytical sensitivity, an in vitro transcript (AHS_ns2. T7) of the target region was constructed and tested. Furthermore, the AHS_ns2. T7 transcript was used either as positive control or as a standard for quantifying target copies. A commercial heterologous Armored RNA was used as an internal positive control (IPC) for both RNA isolation and RT-PCR steps. The qRT-PCR AHS_ns2 was able to amplify the target sequence up to 0.71 copies/reaction. Its flexibility allowed to amplify a wide dynamic range of RNA copies from 1.5 to 0.001. fg. Within this range, the Ct values varied from 18 to 38 cycles with SD values always lower than 0.5 confirming their strong and constant linear correlation with the RNA target. Furthermore the newly designed duplex real-time RT-PCR proved to be strictly AHSV-specific as it did not amplify close related viruses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Brucellosis, a zoonosis caused by the genus Brucella, has been eradicated in Northern Europe, Australia, the USA and Canada, but remains endemic in most areas of the world. The strain and biovar typing of Brucella field samples isolated in outbreaks is useful for tracing back source of infection and may be crucial for discriminating naturally occurring outbreaks versus bioterrorist events, being Brucella a potential biological warfare agent. In the last years MLVA-16 has been described for Brucella spp. genotyping. The MLVA band profiles may be resolved by different techniques i.e. the manual agarose gels, the capillary electrophoresis sequencing systems or the microfluidic Lab-on-Chip electrophoresis. In this paper we described a high throughput system of MLVA-16 typing for Brucella spp. by using of the microfluidics technology. Results: The Caliper LabChip 90 equipment was evaluated for MLVA-16 typing of sixty-three Brucella samples. Furthermore, in order to validate the system, DNA samples previously resolved by sequencing system and Agilent technology, were de novo genotyped. The comparison of the MLVA typing data obtained by the Caliper equipment and those previously obtained by the other analysis methods showed a good correlation. However the outputs were not accurate as the Caliper DNA fragment sizes showed discrepancies compared with real data and a conversion table from observed to expected data was created. Conclusion: In this paper we described the MLVA-16 using a rapid, sophisticated microfluidics technology for detection of amplification product sizes. The comparison of the MLVA typing data produced by Caliper LabChip 90 system with the data obtained by different techniques showed a general concordance of the results. Furthermore this platform represents a significant improvement in terms of handling, data acquiring, computational efficiency and rapidity, allowing to perform the strain genotyping in a time equal to one sixth respect to other microfluidics systems as e.g. the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. Finally, this platform can be considered a valid alternative to standard genotyping techniques, particularly useful dealing with a large number of samples in short time. These data confirmed that this technology represents a significative advancement in high-throughput accurate Brucella genotyping. © 2011 De Santis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={A new method for the calculation of a centrality measure (Disease Flow Centrality, DFC), which takes into account temporal dynamics of livestock movement networks, is proposed. The method is based on a network traversal algorithm which represents an epidemic process more realistically compared with traditional graph traversal algorithms used in the calculation of centrality measures on static networks. The new approach was tested on networks generated from all the registered movements of cattle in Italy in the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 and the results were compared to those obtained by classical centrality measures. The results show that DFC values often differ substantially from those of other centrality measures and that these DFC values tend to be more unstable in time. The DFC offers several advantages for assessing risk and vulnerability of specific holdings and of an entire network, using recent movement data from national livestock databases. Some examples also indicate how the basic approach in the DFC calculation could be expanded into a more complex epidemic model by incorporating weights and how it could be combined with a geo-spatial perspective. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A rapid and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for the qualitative screening analysis of neomycin in food of animal origin (muscle, liver, kidney, eggs and milk) at levels corresponding to the European Union maximum residue limit (MRL) set for this substance. The method validation was performed according to the criteria of Commission Decision 2002/657/EC established for qualitative screening methods. In this regard, the following parameters were determined: detection capability (CCβ), specificity, detection limit (LOD), quantification limit (LOQ), recovery, precision, linearity and ruggedness. LODs ranged from 5.7 μg kg-1 in kidney to 29.3 μg kg-1 in milk; LOQs ranged from 11.4 μg kg-1 in kidney to 59.7 μg kg-1 in eggs. The recoveries from spiked samples at the MRL, half the MRL and double the MRL levels ranged from 65.8% to 122.8%, with a coefficient of variation (CV) between 5.9% and 28.6%. The CCβ value was less than the MRL for all examined matrices. Moderate variations of some critical factors in the sample pretreatment for muscle, milk and eggs were deliberately introduced for ruggedness evaluation and had a slight but not statistically significant effect on method performance. The proposed method is suitable for qualitative screening analysis of neomycin in the above-mentioned food in conformity with current European Union performance requirements. © 2011 Taylor &amp; Francis.},

abstract={Seven farms, two in Central Italy and five in Southern Italy, were visited for the presence of larvae-infested wounds. Ninety-six (3%) out of 3129 sheep examined had a traumatic myiasis with a very high percentage of infested animals found only in a farm (10.5%). Wounds were mainly localized on the vulva and prepuce. Infested animals were restless, anxious, and reluctant to graze. None of the 10 goats in one infested flock had wounds, whereas a shepherd dog from another flock presented a wound on the ear. All the larvae and adults reared from them in the laboratory were identified as Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Schiner, 1862) (Diptera, Sarcophagidae). The cases presented here are the first clinical cases of wohlfahrtiosis in sheep and dogs reported in Italy, and indicate that this myiasis is endemic in this country. A wider epidemiological investigation on the prevalence, incidence and seasonality of W. magnifica infestation of Italian W. magnifica population/s would be useful to understand its geographical provenience and the likely risk for its spreading throughout Italy and other non-endemic areas. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={After a case of Angiostrongylus vasorum (canine lungworm) was diagnosed in the province of Chieti (Italy) in early 2008, parasitological research was conducted to investigate the presence of the parasite in dogs in the area. A total of 178 dogs, 56 carcasses and 122 stool samples were examined between January and September 2008. The carcasses were examined for the presence of adult parasites in the right ventricle and pulmonary artery, and larval forms in the internal organ and brain tissues. The faeces were inspected for larval form L1 using three diagnostic methods that are currently used to test for endoparasites and larvae of bronchopulmonary strongyles. A total of 20 cases of canine angiostrongylosis were diagnosed (8.9%), with adult parasites being identified in 5 dogs, and L1 larvae in another 15. The anatomo-pathological examination of the carcasses of the dogs infested with adult nematodes revealed pneumonia, pleurisy, reddish foam in the trachea, effusion of serohaemorrhagic fluid in the thoracic cavity and enlarged mediastinic and mesenteric lymph nodes. Histological examination of the tissues showed serious, similar syndromes with lesions caused by colonisation of the kidneys, lymph nodes and brain by the parasites. Given the large number of cases confirmed in relation to the period of study (9 months), it is essential to include angiostrongylosis among the differential diagnoses made in clinical and post-mortem examinations of dogs in the province of Chieti and in the neighbouring areas. © Istituto G.

abstract={Relatively little is known about regulatory T (Treg) cells and their functional responses in dogs. We have used the cross-reactive anti-mouse/rat Foxp3 antibody clone FJK-16s to identify a population of canine CD4+ FOXP3high T cells in both the peripheral blood (PB) and popliteal lymph node (LN). FOXP3+ cells in both PB and LN yielded positive staining with the newly developed anti-murine/human Helios antibody clone 22F6, consistent with the notion that they were naturally occurring Treg cells. Stimulation of mononuclear cells of LN origin with concanavalin A (Con A) in vitro yielded increased proportions and median fluorescence intensity of FOXP3 expression by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Removal of the Con A and continued culture disclosed a CD4+ FOXP3high population, distinct from the CD4+ FOXP3intermediate T cells; very few CD8+ FOXP3high T cells were observed, though CD8+ FOXP3intermediate cells were present in equal abundance to CD4+ FOXP3intermediate cells. The CD4+ FOXP3high T cells were thought to represent activated Treg cells, in contrast to the FOXP3intermediate cells, which were thought to be a more heterogeneous population comprising predominantly activated conventional T cells. Co-staining with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) supported this notion, because the FOXP3high T cells were almost exclusively IFN-γ-, whereas the FOXP3intermediate cells expressed a more heterogeneous IFN-γ phenotype. Following activation of mononuclear cells with Con A and interleukin-2, the 5% of CD4+ T cells showing the highest CD25 expression (CD4+ CD25high) were enriched in cells expressing FOXP3. These cells were anergic in vitro, in contrast to the 20% of CD4+ T cells with the lowest CD25 expression (CD4+ CD25-), which proliferated readily. The CD4+ CD25high FOXP3high T cells were able to suppress the proliferation of responder CD4+ T cells in vitro, in contrast to the CD4+ CD25- cells, which showed no regulatory properties. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Common sole (Solea solea) is one of the most interesting species for diversification of aquaculture production in the Mediterranean area, but production of sole on an industrial scale has not yet begun. In the present study, larval rearing was performed in 1 cubic meter tanks with a re-circulating system, using the "green water" technique. After an initial mortality occurred during the first 10 days of larval rearing, no particular mortality was registered during weaning period until 69 dph (day post hatching). On 66 dph, because of technical problems, fish were transferred in a new tank with open system where temperature control was not possible and water temperature increased from 19°C to 24°C in three days. Four days later and for the following ten days we registered a mortality rate of 84.5%. Microbiological analysis revealed the absence of Betanodavirus and the presence of Vibrio anguillarum O2 and of Tenacibaculum maritimum; the former represents the first isolation on common sole in Italy. Histology revealed necrotic-haemorrhagic lesions in brain, kidney and gut, and severe skin erosions, the latter especially on fish collected at the end of the outbreak. Moreover the pathogens have been detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). This severe mortality could be interpreted as a multi-factorial event where post-weaning weakness, manipulation, higher temperature and pathogens could have had a synergic effect. The extreme stress susceptibility of S. solea, pointed out in this and previous papers is discussed.},

Mosquitoes, blood, serum and tissue samples, from horses and birds, within and around the outbreak area, have been collected and tested by various methods both serologically and virologically. West Nile virus strains have been isolated from blood samples of one horse and one donkey and from pools of brain, kidneys, heart and spleen of a pigeon and three magpies.

abstract={In the 2004, the Sardinian bluetongue (BT) vaccination campaign used the combination of monovalent BTV-2, BTV-4 and BTV-16 modified-live vaccines manufactured by the Onderstepoort Biological Products in South Africa. Following vaccination, some herds showed temperature, oedema, lameness, hyperaemia and decrease in milk production, and some others remained perfectly healthy. This study aimed to evaluate whether important factors present in the herd at the time of vaccination could be associated to the occurrence of undesired effects observed after immunisation with BTV modified-live vaccines. A sample of 17 sheep and 4 goat flocks, for a total of 670 animals, were included in the study and risk factors such as presence of most important parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases as well as anomalies of biochemical and haematological parameters were associated to the presence or absence of side effects. For each factor the relative risk and 95% confidence interval were calculated. Following vaccination, bluetongue-like symptoms were observed in 13 flocks. In these flocks, a higher (P<0.05) proportion of animals had viraemia and showed higher titers to BTV-16 after immunisation. Positive association (RR=2.50, 1.17-5.04) was also found between flocks in which undesired effect were observed and positive serology against Maedi-Visna virus. On the contrary, presence of BTV genome fractions in the blood of animals at the time of vaccination was found to be protective (RR=0.7, 0.58-0.84) to the occurrence of undesired effect subsequent to BTV vaccination. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Macrophages are pivotal cells of the immune system and play a key role in the host defence mechanism against pathogens. To date, the importance of macrophages and the role of humoral response in eliciting macrophage activity against Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony (Mmm-SC), the causative agent of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), have only been marginally elucidated or are almost unknown. The present study was undertaken to investigate the changes in surface morphology of macrophages after in vitro infection with Mmm-SC in the presence of bovine immune serum. Morphological analysis was performed on macrophage cultures at 6 h post infection using the three-dimensional vision of scanning electron microscopy. Noninfected macrophages in the presence of negative or immune serum and macrophages infected with Mmm-SC in the absence of serum showed only minor cell surface changes. In contrast, clear surface modifications, broad veils, fine philopodia highlighting cell activation and small aggregates of mycoplasma closely attached to the macrophage membrane, were observed in infected macrophage cultures in the presence of immune serum. Our results suggest that specific humoral response to Mmm-SC may contribute and support phagocytic activity of macrophages. © Istituto G. Caporale 2010.},

abstract={In a rabbit production facility, health monitoring for enteropathies was performed in 15 production cycles for 20 mo. For each cycle, up to a hundred 35 d old rabbits weaned the same day were randomly selected, reared in the same fattening unit, but separately from the source batch and fed with the same feed except for antimicrobial supplementation. Clinical symptoms and enteric lesions of the selected group were recorded, using two checklists with binomial response (yes/no answer to a list of 54 clinical and enteric variables). The day after weaning, one week later, at the beginning of the enteric symptoms and 4-5 d after the start of the symptoms, inocula from the small intestine and caecum of selected animals were subjected to microbiological, C. spiroforme, Eimeria oocyst and rotavirus antigen detection tests. Representative samples of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates were tested, respectively, for serotype, biotype, eae, afr/2 genes and for a, ß1, ß2, ε, i and enterotoxin toxin genes. The answers to the clinical-pathological variables were subjected to statistical analysis with a cluster analysis programme in order to obtain homogeneous, statistically significant groups of diseased animals (clusters). Then, the clusters were statistically associated with the laboratory outcomes. The cluster to which the enterotyphlitis lesions significantly contributed was associated with E. coli detection, E. coli 0103 serotype detection and C. spiroforme ("several elements" variable). C. spiroforme ("rare elements" variable) was significantly associated with a cluster, characterised by a pathological profile consisting of bloating/rumbling noise and liquid content in stomach and caecum, without enteric inflammation. C. perfringens was significantly associated with a cluster, characterised by a pathological profile consisting of dilation/liquid content of small intestine, caecal impaction and mucoid content in the colon. Eighteen out of twenty-five C. perfringens strains, examined for their toxin genotypes, proved to be toxin type A, while 7 out of 25 strains showed the α and ß2 toxin genes in combination. The rotavirus antigen and Eimeria oocysts were detected from healthy rabbits (specimens of the day after weaning and one week later) in about 15% of specimens examined, but their presence in the sick animals was not significantly associated with any cluster. © WRSA UPV 2003.},

abstract={A questionnaire was distributed to the state veterinary services of all 172 OIE countries to collect data on the different national approaches to dog population control. We used all 81 completed questionnaires with ≥80% of the question answered to identify the different national approaches to the issue. The intensity of the free-roaming dog (FRD) problem was negatively correlated with the value of the UN's human development index recognized for each country. Dog bites/attacks and rabies were the main problems associated with FRDs, and these problems were reported disproportionately by less-developed countries. Dog-control programs (DCP) were more widely used among the more-developed countries. In less-developed countries, DCPs (when they existed at all) tended to employ killing methods (including poisoned baits), that are not recommended on animal-welfare grounds. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In accordance with European Union regulations, from 5 February until 15 December 2008, sampling and analysis activities were conducted in Italy to assess the extent of contamination caused by thermotolerant Campylobacter in broiler chickens farmed nationwide. The survey involved 48 poultry slaughterhouses distributed across eleven regions of Italy, where the caeca and carcasses of 393 slaughter batches were sampled. A total of 284 batches (72.3%) gave positive results for Campylobacter spp. as follows: 52.1% were contaminated by C. jejuni, 55.6% by C. coli and 1.1% by C. lari. C. jejuni and C. coli were isolated together in 37 batches (13% of positive results). Campylobacter spp. was isolated only from the caeca in 251 slaughter batches (63.9%) including caecal isolates of C. jejuni (48.2%), C. coli (50.6%), and C. lari (1.2%). Carcasses from 182 batches (46.3%) were contaminated by C. jejuni in 40.7% of cases, C. coli in 57.7% and the absence of C. lari from all batches examined. The contamination level observed in the carcasses ranged between 10 and 1.6 × 107 cfu/g. © Istituto G. Caporale 2010.},

abstract={With the support of European Community funds, three submerged artificial reefs composed of concrete cubes, bell-shaped modules and natural rocks were deployed along the Adriatic coast of the Abruzzi Region to increase the fish population and to prevent illegal trawling. The Provincial governments of Teramo and Pescara requested the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise 'G. Caporale' to monitor nectobenthic populations. Three sampling operations were conducted each year for each artificial reef. The authors present the results of a study conducted between 2005 and 2007, comparing the catches from the artificial reefs with those from the control sites using several diversity indexes. Artificial reef areas revealed greater species diversity and richness than the control sites. This study demonstrates the value of artificial reefs in response to the problem of low income, non-commercial fisheries as well as to the issue of over-exploitation of halieutic resources. In addition, the authors suggest that artificial reefs may be capable of activating habitat diversification processes that will increase biodiversity. © Istituto G. Caporale 2010.},

abstract={In late 2008, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 6 (BTV-6), which had never occurred in Europe before, was first detected in the Netherlands and Germany. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, the prevalence of infections in cattle was investigated in a virological (N=28,658) and serological (N=2075) field survey in Lower Saxony, where 45 cases confined to the district Grafschaft Bentheim were found. Blood from affected animals was used for the experimental infection of three cattle with different BTV antibody status, leading to sustained viraemia in one animal naïve for BTV. Of two animals that had detectable antibodies against BTV serotype 8, one became transiently infected and seroconverted for BTV-6 while the other did not react. In conclusion, while only a very limited spread of BTV-6 could be observed in the field, experimental infection of cattle did not show substantial differences of the course of infection in comparison to other BTV serotypes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Specific humoral immune responses in a clinical trial on cattle for vaccines against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) were investigated. The trial included a subunit vaccine consisting of five recombinant putative variable surface proteins of the infectious agent Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides small colony type (M. mycoides SC) compared to the currently approved attenuated vaccine strain T1/44 and untreated controls. Humoral immune responses to 65 individual recombinant surface proteins of M. mycoides SC were monitored by a recently developed bead-based array assay. Responses to the subunit vaccine components were found to be weak. Animals vaccinated with this vaccine were not protected and had CBPP lesions similar to those of the untreated controls. In correlating protein-specific humoral responses to T1/44-induced immunity, five proteins associated with a protective immune response were identified by statistical evaluation, namely, MSC-1046 (LppQ), MSC-0271, MSC-0136, MSC-0079, and MSC-0431. These five proteins may be important candidates in the development of a novel subunit vaccine against CBPP. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The authors evaluated the prevalence of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp. and staphylococcal enterotoxin in 2 132 samples selected from six types of cheese on the basis of recorded consumption in Italy in 2004. In L. monocytogenes-positive samples the precise level of contamination was determined. To define the physical-chemical characteristics of the selected natural cheeses, the pH values, water activity and sodium chloride content were determined. The results suggest that blue and soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert, Gorgonzola and Taleggio) are more likely to be contaminated with L. monocytogenes. The mean prevalence of L. monocytogenes in the six types of cheese was 2.4% (from 0.2% in Asiago and Crescenza to 6.5% in Taleggio), with contamination levels of up to 460 MPN/g. No presence of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157 was found in any sample. Staphylococcal enterotoxin was found in 0.6% of the samples examined. Physical and chemical parameter values confirmed that all types of cheese are considered capable of supporting the growth of L. monocytogenes. The study confirmed the need to apply effective control at production and sales levels to reduce the probability of contamination by L. monocytogenes. This micro-organism can attain high levels of contamination in food products, such as cheeses that have a long shelf-life when associated with difficulties of maintaining appropriate storage temperatures in both sales points and in the home. © IZS A&M 2010.},

abstract={A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a green fluorescence dye, followed by a comparison of derivative melting curves in the post-amplification phase, was developed to distinguish species of Culicoides within the Obsoletus Complex. The selected target sequence was internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS 2) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). Using the newly developed method, 140 midges were morphologically classified in the Obsoletus Complex and were processed. The results were compared to those obtained by combining the morphological identification with the gel based reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. By analysing the species-specific pattern of the dissociation curves, it was possible to identify 52 midges as Culicoides scoticus, 82 midges as C. obsoletus sensu strictu and 6 as C. montanus. These results matched those obtained by the combination of gel-based PCR and morphological identification used on a routine basis. Given its diagnostic flexibility, rapid results, automation capability, high quality result performance and expression, the real-time ITS 2 rDNA PCR appears to be more functional and efficient than the gel-based PCR, especially when dealing with large-scale monitoring of midges belonging to the Obsoletus Complex. © IZS A&M 2010.},

abstract={The Province of Pesaro-Urbino, situated in the Marche Region of central Italy, can be considered to be an area at risk for Lyme disease because of its ecological features. Field data are not yet available although the disease is known to be present in neighbouring areas. During a field study lasting twelve months, ticks were collected from the vegetation, from wild cervids and also from humans who reported a tick bite at the local hospital. All ticks were identified and Ixodes ricinus specimens were tested using three different polymerase chain reaction tests for the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl). To identify the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sl, a fragment of the 5S-23S ribosomal rRNA intergenic spacer of the positive samples was amplified and then sequenced. Sequencing of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer led to the identification of two different genospecies, namely: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. lusitaniae, both of which are involved in cases of human infection. Findings on the hosttick relationships and on the genospecies involved in the cycle of borreliosis confirm the suitable conditions for Lyme disease in the study area. The results concur with previous findings reported in the Mediterranean region. © IZS A&M 2010.},

The course was designed to train veterinary officers involved in disease outbreak management, laboratory diagnosis, and policy making. The "blended learning model" was applied, involving participants in tutor-supported self-learning, collaborative learning activities, and virtual classes. The course duration was 16 hr spread over a 4-wk period. Six editions were implemented for 705 participants. All participants completed the evaluation assignments, and the drop out rate was very low (only 4%).

abstract={The bluetongue (BT) epidemic that has prevailed in Europe since 2000 is the first example of continental spread of the BT virus (BTV) in large naive populations of susceptible animals. Based on the results of intensive surveillance and research in countries of the southern Mediterranean that were affected by the infection early on in the epidemic, a new strategy for prevention and control of the disease was developed to limit direct losses and to reduce the consequences due to movement restrictions. The basic innovations that were introduced were the use of mass vaccination of all domestic ruminant species to limit the spread of BTV and the use of intensive active surveillance to limit, as far as possible, the zone where movement restrictions must be applied. The novel strategy that was adopted dramatically reduced the number of clinical outbreaks in southern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin and ensured safer animal trade. In 2006, the first BTV-8 epidemic occurred, this time in north-western Europe. During this epidemic, affected countries adopted a 'wait and see' approach. No vaccination was implemented until 2008 and, in many instances, the movement of animals was authorised within restricted areas, thereby facilitating the spread of infection. The delay in administering vaccination was due to the decision to avoid the use of modified live virus vaccines, although this type of vaccine performed satisfactorily in the previous BT epidemics in southern Europe. Bluetongue has demonstrated that the infectious agents present in southern Africa can easily spread to the Mediterranean Basin, which should be considered a single entity as far as the epidemiology of animal diseases is concerned. Therefore, any effective strategy for the prevention and control of animal disease in Europe must take into account this reality and recognise the need for regional surveillance networks that include all the countries that border the Mediterranean.},

The research involved conducting 96-hour tests on clams farmed in aquariums containing filtered seawater. The tests were preceded by a 7-day adaptation stage to allow the molluscs to acclimatise. During this period, the clams were fed on unicellular seaweed (Dunaliella tertiolecta). The molluscs were exposed to particles of solids in suspension consisting of pools of silica gel (SiO2) granules of various sizes, similar to those constituting silt, whose presence and suspension in the sea considerably increase after heavy rain and heavy seas. The study established that the number of deaths caused by solids suspended in seawater at the concentrations used in the tests was not statistically significant.},

abstract={Approximately 250,000 water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) live in the Campania region of southern Italy where the breeding of this species is very popular. Of these animals, almost 150,000 are concentrated in the Caserta province where the prevalence of Brucella abortus in this species represents approximately 20% at herd level. The Italian brucellosis eradication programme provides a slaughter and vaccination strategy for this province. B. abortus strain RB51 (RB51) has become the official vaccine for the prevention of brucellosis in cattle in several countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of RB51 in water buffalo compared to the B. abortus S19 vaccine (S19). The study was performed in accordance with a protocol described in mice. Female buffalo aged five months were inoculated. Five received a RB51 dosage on two occasions that was three times greater than that approved for use in cattle and a booster after one month, five received B. abortus S19 vaccine at the standard dosage and three controls received a phosphate buffer solution. Buffalo were then challenged with a virulent B. abortus strain 544 thirty days post vaccination. Antibodies that developed in the five animals vaccinated with RB51 were not detected by the Rose Bengal test or complement fixation test (CFT) and were also tested by CFT prepared with RB51 antigen. After culling, B. abortus was cultured from the spleen, retropharyngeal and supra-mammary lymph nodes. A statistical evaluation was performed to assess the immunogenicity values obtained in buffalo vaccinated with S19, compared to those obtained in buffalo vaccinated with the RB51 vaccine and in the unvaccinated control group.},

The first collection involved 19 isolates from rabbits. The second collection of 41 isolates came from routine necropsies. The cpa gene alone, or in association with the cpb2 gene, was detected in all DNA samples examined. The cpa gene, together with cpb2 gene, were detected in seven of the rabbit C. perfringens strains (36.8%) and in nine isolates from necropsies (21.9%). The cpa gene was found in 63.2% of rabbit strains and 76.9% of strains from other animal species. In rabbits, the pathological lesions associated with C. perfringens detection were predominantly forms of non-inflammatory enteropathies. In other species, C. perfringens was mainly associated with congestive-haemorrhagic enteropathy, but also with fatal traumatic lesions, degenerative diseases and organs with post-mortem autolysis. No clear correlation was observed between detection of beta2 toxin gene and species-specific pathological features.},

abstract={A multi-scale object-based classification was carried out using data from three different sensors to map classes of interest in the framework of the EPISTIS project. This project aims to highlight the spatio-temporal patterns that underlie the epidemiology of certain diseases and more particularly of bluetongue in this case-study. A SPOT5 10m XS image of Sardinia taken in the springtime was segmented and the land-cover/land-use classes that are the most easily discriminated were mapped using a thresholding approach. Subsequently, a DEM was used as ancillary data to map the riparian vegetation. The remaining vegetation classes were then mapped using a nearest-neighbour algorithm. ASTER features, notably derived from the SWIR bands, were used in addition to SPOT in the feature space to improve vegetation discrimination. Images taken in the springtime allow for a good discrimination between semi-natural vegetation and arable land, which was the initial objective. However, project developments implied further discrimination within the arable land. Due to their spectral similarity at this resolution in a patchy Mediterranean landscape, a number of classes could not be sufficiently well classified even using additional textural and contextual features. Therefore, data derived from MODIS vegetation indices time series were included in the classification process so as to account for the vegetation dynamics and improve the classification results.},

abstract={Assessing changes in species range is based on identifying new occurrences in areas where absence has been inferred due to lack of previous records. This technique depends on creating a consistent observational dataset, based on comparable detection methods. 2. In Mediterranean countries, the midge Culicoides imicola is the principal vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) that causes an infectious disease of domestic and wild ruminants. Over the last 10 years, BTV has invaded Mediterranean countries (1998) and much of Northern Europe (2006); this unprecedented spread is reported to be a possible consequence of climate change. In southern Europe, based on recent observations found in northern latitudes, BTV spread has been attributed in part to changes in C. imicola distribution. However, current sampling of Culicoides spp. is far more intensive and targeted than that undertaken before the first BTV epidemics; this obviously results in new information from areas in which collections would have had little chance of positive identification in the past. 3. Since 2001, a national surveillance programme based on permanent traps was established in Italy to follow C. imicola population dynamics in space and time. Based on data from 2000 to 2001 cross-sectional studies, Italy was divided into three zones (I: endemicity; II: transition; III: absence) in which longitudinal data on C. imicola presence and abundance were analysed as a function of time between 2002 and 2007 through linear and quantile regressions. 4. The results from the surveillance programme demonstrate no detectable range expansion of the C. imicola population in Italy between 2002 and 2007. 5.Synthesis and applications. This study provides strong evidence that there has been no measurable range expansion between 2002 and 2007 in a species previously described as moving northwards as a result of climate change. For any reliable conclusions to be drawn on the range distribution of C. imicola or other similar vector species in Southern Europe, the Culicoides surveillance system across all European countries should be designed to provide comparable data based on a constant detection probability over time. © 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={West Nile virus (WNV) has a history of irregular but recurrent epizootics in countries of Mediterranean and of Central and Eastern Europe. We have investigated the temporal enzootic activity of WNV in free-ranging birds over a 3-year period in an area with sporadic occurrences of WNV outbreaks in Southern France. We conducted an intensive serologic survey on several wild bird populations (>4000 serum samples collected from 3300 birds) selected as potential indicators of the WNV circulation. WNV antibodies were detected by seroneutralization and/or plaque reduction neutralization in house sparrows, black-billed magpies, and scops owls, but these species appeared to be insufficient indicators of WNV circulation. Overall seroprevalence was low (<1%), including in birds that had been potentially exposed to the virus during recent outbreaks. However, the detection of a seroconversion in one bird, as well as the detection of seropositive birds in all years of our monitoring, including juveniles, indicate a constant annual circulation of WNV at a low level, including in years without any detectable emergence of WN fever in horses or humans. © 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Goats were infected experimentally with a mycoplasma (the "Irbid" strain) isolated previously from a goat with contagious agalactia in northern Jordan. The strain was unusual in that, although it had been identified by molecular methods as Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides LC/Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri, it showed no inhibition of growth by any of the hyperimmune rabbit antisera conventionally used to speciate members of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster. Animals were infected either intratracheally or by aerosol and placed "in-contact" with other goats. After 2 weeks, those infected intratracheally became febrile, showing a nasal discharge and slight conjunctivitis, followed a week later by respiratory distress and polyarthritis; lesions seen at necropsy included coagulative necrotic pneumonia, fibrinous pleurisy with pleural exudate, and inflammatory exudates, necrosis and fibrosis in the joints. Animals infected by aerosol showed much milder clinical signs, including nasal discharge and occasional swollen joints. In the "in-contact" goats, seroconversion was first seen after 7 weeks, accompanied by coughing and laboured respiration; lesions in this group consisted of fibrinous pneumonia with focal areas of necrosis and abundant pleural exudate.

abstract={This study described the first report of BTV-16 in Croatia. Serological evidence occurred in cattle at the end of September and continued during October and November 2004. All positive animals were in the Dubrovnik-Neretva County, a region located in the southernmost part of Croatia. BTV-16 infection was also detected in goats and sheep. Apart from few cases reported in Greece between 1999 and 2000, BTV-16 has never been reported in the Balkanic peninsula before. The BTV strain was isolated from cattle blood samples and typed as BTV-16. When the S5 was sequenced, it showed 100% homology with the BTV-16 vaccine isolate produced by Ondersterpoort Biological Product (SA) and used in Italy during the 2004 BT vaccination campaign. On the other hand no complete homology was found when the same RNA segment sequence was compared with that of the homologous Italian field isolate. As no evidence of livestock movements from Italy was demonstrated, an eolic transmission of the infection through infected Culicoides was hypothesised. According to the local meteostations, in several occasions, during the 2004 summer months, the west-east breeze blew with a speed above 50 km/h from Italy towards the Dubrovnik County. It is concluded that the BTV-16 which infected Croatian livestock was similar to the homologous OBP vaccine isolate and it is likely that it was introduced from Italy into the Southern regions of Croatia through infected Culicoides carried by the wind. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The scope of this review is to present an overview of the scientific opinions issued by the BIOHAZ Panel on foodborne zoonoses during its first mandate (2003-2006). Zoonoses are diseases or infections that are transmissible from animals to humans either directly or through ingestion of contaminated foodstuffs. The most frequently reported zoonotic diseases in humans in the EU are salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. During the past decades trichinellosis has been described as an emerging and/or re-emerging disease. In order to improve public health and to prevent these diseases from occurring, it is important to identify which animals and foodstuffs are the main sources of the infections and which intervention strategies would be most effective. The European Commission follows a scientific evidence-based approach to managing the risks of zoonotic agents throughout the food chain based on the risk assessments produced from the BIOHAZ Panel. This leads to the development and enforcement of legislation and/or other measures on zoonoses and zoonotic agents. © 2009.},

abstract={Gyrodactylus orecchiae sp. n. (Monogenea, Gyrodactylidae) is described from the skin, fins, eyes and gills of juvenile Sparus aurata L. (gilthead seabream) following two outbreaks of gyrodactylosis amongst stocks held in inshore floating cages on the Adriatic coast of Albania and Croatia. Fish were heavily infected (1000+ gyrodactylids/fish) with G. orecchiae which reportedly resulted in ~2-10% mortality amongst the infected stock. Morphologically, the haptoral hooks of G. orecchiae most closely resemble those of Gyrodactylus arcuatus Bychowsky, 1933 in the approximate shape of the ventral bar with its pronounced ventral bar processes and marginal hook sickles which possess a square line to the inner edge of the sickle blade and large rounded heels. The marginal hooks are also morphologically similar to those of Gyrodactylus quadratidigitus Longshaw, Pursglove et Shinn, 2003 and Gyrodactylus colemanensis Mizelle et Kritsky, 1967, but G. orecchiae can be readily discriminated from all three species by the characteristic infolding of the hamuli roots and the shape of the marginal hook sickle. Molecular sequencing of the ITS1, 5.8S, ITS2 regions (513+157+404 bp, respectively) of G. orecchiae and alignment with other gyrodactylids for which these same genomic regions have been determined, suggests that this is a new species. No similarities were found when the ITS1 region of G. orecchiae was compared with 84 species of Gyrodactylus available on GenBank. © Institute of Parasitology.},

abstract={A precise and reliable method for the determination of 10 sulphonamide antibiotics (sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfachloropyridazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamonomethoxine, sulfadimethoxine and sulfaquinoxaline) in egg by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been developed. Drugs were extracted using a mixture of dichloromethane/acetone (50:50, v/v), acidified with acetic acid and then cleaned-up on a cation-exchange solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The chromatographic separation was performed by gradient on a C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol-water containing 0.1% formic acid and 5 mM ammonium acetate, then sulphonamides were detected in a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive electrospray ionization mode (ESI+). The method was validated at 15, 30 and 45 μg kg-1. These levels were much lower than the corresponding maximum residue limit of 100 μg kg-1 set for sulphonamides in several matrices but not in eggs, where the presence of such residues is not permitted. Results were quantitated against the selected internal standard 13C6-sulphamethazine and also according to the matrix-matched approach. The within-laboratory reproducibility, expressed as a relative standard deviation, never exceeded 21%. All decision limit (CCα) values lied in the range between 16.1 and 20.5 μg kg-1 and the corresponding results for detection capability (CCβ) were 16.9 and 25.7 μg kg-1. Ruggedness was estimated according to the Youden robustness test. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Quinolones are a group of chemotherapeutic agents with an excellent efficiency against poultry pathogens. Two commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests have been applied in parallel for the qualitative screening analysis of several quinolones in eggs, poultry muscle and feeds at the required levels. During the validation study, carried out according to the Commission Decision 2002/657/EC criteria, two different sample treatments were compared in foods: the simple and fast procedure suggested by the kit producer (Euro-Diagnostica) and a more complex solid-phase extraction (SPE) sample preparation. The results demonstrated that the method based on SPE clean up exhibited better characteristic performances, particularly in eggs for which lower detection levels are required. Despite the fact that screening methods should be rapid and cheap, the use of non-chromatographic techniques such as ELISA for multiresidual detection of a class of substances involves some additional attention to sample preparation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Leishmaniasis from Leishmania infantum is a parasitary zoonotic disease and a serious problem to public health. Guidelines from Italian Health Authority (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) suggest to control the zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis canine reservoir in endemic areas using an association of preventive and therapeutic tools. Moreover, in literature there are no studies about the long term effects on the disease seroprevalence and incidence in relation to this "holistic" approach. Past research has considered the effects of the alternative employment of preventive or therapeutic treatment, usually for limited periods. In this retrospective study the patterns of seroprevalence and incidence of leishmaniasis in a dog shelter sited in an endemic area of Central Italy are described throughout a 4-year period. Both preventive spot-on tools (imidacloprid/permetrin) and therapeutic protocols based on antimonials and allopurinol were administered. The results showed a progressive reduction of prevalence and incidence of serological reactivity to L. infantum, corroborating the effectiveness of the treatment administered to the animals. Significant improvements from the beginning to the end of the 4-year period were reported, considering both prevalence and incidence. A very low rate of relapses (8% in a pool of 67 subjects positive since 2004; 10.2% among all subjects enrolled in the study) was achieved. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The efficacy of a bivalent inactivated vaccine against bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 2 (BTV-2) and 4 (BTV-4) was evaluated in cattle by general and local examination, serological follow-up, and challenge. Thirty-two 4-month-old calves were randomly allocated into 2 groups of 16 animals each. One group was vaccinated subcutaneously (s/c) with two injections of bivalent inactivated vaccine at a 28-day interval, and the second group was left unvaccinated and used as control. Sixty-five days after first vaccination, 8 vaccinated and 8 unvaccinated calves were s/c challenged with 1 mL of 6.2 Log 10 TCID50/mL of an Italian field isolate of BTV serotype 2, while the remaining 8 vaccinated and 8 unvaccinated animals were challenged by 1 mL of 6.2 Log 10 TCID50/mL of an Italian field isolate of BTV serotype 4. Three additional calves were included in the study and used as sentinels to confirm that no BTV was circulating locally. At the time of the challenge, only one vaccinated animal did not have neutralizing antibodies against BTV-4, while the remaining 15 showed titres of at least 1:10 for either BTV-2 or BTV-4. However, the BTV-2 component of the inactivated vaccine elicited a stronger immune response in terms of both the number of virus neutralization (VN) positive animals and antibody titres. After challenge, no animal showed signs of disease. Similarly, none of the vaccinated animals developed detectable viraemia while bluetongue virus serotype 2 and 4 titres were detected in the circulating blood of all unvaccinated animals, commencing on day 3 post-challenge and lasting 16 days. It is concluded that administration of the bivalent BTV-2 and BTV-4 inactivated vaccine resulted in a complete prevention of detectable viraemia in all calves when challenged with high doses of BTV-2 or BTV-4. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Campylobacteriosis is the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans within the European Union. The consumption of contaminated chicken meat is considered one of the main sources of human infection. Although there are no official data on the incidence of Campylobacter infection in Italy, the available studies suggest that this infection is a major problem also in Italy. The authors developed a simulation model to quantitatively estimate the expected annual number of human cases of campylobacteriosis in the Italian regions of Abruzzo and Molise, due to the cross-contamination during the handling of Campylobacter jejuni contaminated chicken meat in domestic kitchen. The authors considered two different models for the dose-response relationship, given their crucial effects on the model's outputs. The expected percentage of human population, experiencing Campylobacter gastroenteritis episodes every year in Abruzzo e Molise regions, varied between 0.8% and 1.8%, according to the dose-response model. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Transport can be a stressful experience for animals, and that means ethical and economic consequences. OIE guidelines and the EU new regulation aim at preventing inadequate conditions of transport, making operators fully responsible of animal welfare and requiring specific certificates of competence. In comparison with other farmed species, relatively few papers have been published on sheep transport. This could be due to lower economic significance and to apparently minor impact of poor transport on sheep meat quality. However, in the last decades several researches were produced on this subject, pointing a number of welfare parameters of behavioural, clinic, physiopathologic, environmental and inspective nature. In this review different potential stressor agents have been evaluated: animal handling (particularly loading and unloading), stocking density, travel duration, rest times, environmental conditions and personnel skills. Further studies could be useful to improve knowledge about basic welfare parameters regarding this species, such as microclimate conditions on transport means (mostly about different standards for shorn or unshorn sheep) and actual effects on meat quality.},

abstract={One of the most important steps when preparing a live attenuated vaccine is the assessment of the level of attenuation in target animals. It is costly and time consuming as it requires, on each occasion, a large number of susceptible animals and contained accommodation. This study assessed the consistency of the bovine foetal aorta endothelial (BFA) cell line and newborn mice for evaluating the attenuation level of BTV4, BTV9 and BTV16 Italian field isolates. Following serial passages in BHK21c13 or Vero cell cultures, BTV attenuated clones demonstrated a reduced replication capability in the BFA cells compared to the homologous virulent strains. Similarly, following intracerebral inoculation, the attenuated clones were completely innocuous to newborn mice contrary to the homologous virulent strains which killed all animals within 10 days. Vaccines produced with the BTV9 or BTV4 attenuated clones were safe, immunogenic and capable of preventing clinical symptoms and viraemia in sheep following challenge with homologous virulent virus. The two assays may be valuable indicators of the gradual changes occurring in the BTV population leading to virus attenuation, they can predict the safety of a BTV attenuated vaccine and, in turn, reduce the number of sheep and cattle required to assess the level of attenuation attained. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Filter-feeding bivalve molluscs are often contaminated by algal toxins. We have probed whether proteomic analysis of extracts from the digestive gland (DG) of mussels could be employed to identify biomarkers of contamination due to okadaic acid-group toxins. The protein extracts were obtained from 18 separate mussel samples and were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. When samples were divided into four different classes based on the content of OA-group toxins in the starting material, we found that two proteins varied as a function of OA contamination. By BLAST analysis, the two proteins were identified as a component of photosystem II and a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase. The analysis of peptide homologies showed that the peptide of photosystem II we detected in extracts from the DG of mussels contaminated by OA-group toxins is identical to its counterpart in Dinophysis algae, which are the producers of this group of toxins. We concluded that proteomic analysis can be used for the detection and identification of biomarkers of biotoxin contamination in shellfish, including both proteins expressed by the toxin producers and components that participate to the tissue response to the exogenous bioactive contaminant. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this paper, we have reported an immunoassay with time-resolved revelation system for ampicillin in raw milk samples. Immunological methods appear to be a promising approach in the analysis of β-lactam compounds, because they do not need previous sample pre-treatments. In fact, β-lactam ring is not very stable in extensive sample pre-treatment procedures requested in conventional analytical techniques. Specimens were collected from lactating cows bred in various conditions and assayed for the fat contents. Ampicillin was assayed in samples with different fat concentrations. The assay was performed using ampicillin-specific polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit; the immunogen was synthesized using bovine thyroglobulin conjugated to ampicillin by glutaraldehyde reaction; as fluorescent marker we used goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with a chelating molecule complexed with Eu3+. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugated with ampicillin was synthesized and used to prepare a solid phase on polystyrene microtiter plates. The use of a lanthanide chelate as label allowed to achieve 1 ng mL-1 sensitivity, which is four times more sensitive than limits requested from European Community. Fat contents did not affect the assay performance. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Culicoides were captured at a BTV-infected dairy near Gulpen in the province of Limburg (south-east Netherlands) between 14 September and 4 October 2006. Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps were used to sample Culicoides both inside and outside a partially open shed housing 11 cattle. A total of 28 light trap collections were made at the shed and yielded:•9371 Culicoides representing 11 species; &gt;90% comprised five potential vectors of BTV and in order of abundance were Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus (of the Obsoletus Complex), Culicoides dewulfi, Culicoides pulicaris and Culicoides chiopterus; Culicoides imicola, the principal Mediterranean (and African) vector of BTV, was absent.•2339 Culicoides representing seven species were captured inside (endophily) the cattle shed; &gt;95% comprised the Obsoletus Complex and C. dewulfi. Conversely, the Pulicaris Complex, represented by five species and including C. pulicaris, showed strong exophily with &gt;97% captured outside the shed.•7032 Culicoides were captured outside the shed, approximately threefold more than inside. This trend was reversed on an overcast day, when eightfold more Culicoides were captured inside; this indicates that when the light intensity outdoors is low Culicoides will attack (i) earlier in the day while cattle are still at pasture, and (ii) might follow cattle into the sheds in the late afternoon leading to elevated numbers of biting midges being trapped inside the shed during the subsequent hours of darkness.•Culicoides were captured inside the shed on all 14 sampling nights. On occasion up to 33% were freshly blood fed indicating they had avidly attacked the cattle inside (endophagy); because half the cattle had seroconverted to BTV, and because no cattle were left outdoors at night, the data indicate that (i) the housing of animals in partially open buildings does not interrupt the transmission of BTV, and/or (ii) BTV is being transmitted while cattle are grazing outdoors during the day.•The capture of partially engorged midges inside the shed shows they are being disturbed while feeding; this may lead to cattle being attacked repeatedly, and if these attacks include older parous BTV-infected Culicoides, may enhance virus dissemination (particularly in sheds where cattle stand close together).•Endo- and exophagy by potential vector Culicoides - coupled to increased adult longevity and multiple feeding events in single (potentially) infected midges - would ensure an R0 of &gt;1, resulting in the continued maintenance and spread of BTV within local vertebrate populations.•Four light trap collections made additionally in a mature deciduous forest 70 m from the shed yielded a high proportion (48%) of gravid females amongst which 10% had incompletely digested blackened blood meals in their abdomens; the absence of this age category in Culicoides captured at the sheds indicates that all Culicoides, after engorgement, exit the buildings to undergo oogenesis elsewhere. In Europe, the blacklight trap is used widely for the nocturnal monitoring of Culicoides; a drawback to this approach is that this trap cannot be used to sample midges that are active during the day. Because diurnal biting in vector Culicoides may constitute a significant and underestimated component of BTV transmission a novel capture methodology will be required in future and is discussed briefly. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A novel method was developed and implemented during the recent outbreak of bluetongue (BT) in sheep and cattle in The Netherlands to obtain rapidly a 'snapshot' of Culicoides vector densities at the national level. The country was divided into 110 raster cells, each measuring 20 km × 20 km; within 106 of these cells, a farm was selected with a minimum of 10 cattle and sampled for Culicoides for one night only using the Onderstepoort-type blacklight trap. Prior to deployment of the light traps in the field, local veterinarians were trained in their use and in the preservation of captured Culicoides. The collections were despatched daily by courier to a field laboratory where the Culicoides were counted and identified. The 'snapshot' commenced on 12 September 2006 and was completed on 28 September coinciding with the 5-7 weeks of BT virus (BTV) activity in The Netherlands and when the number of weekly cases of disease was on the rise. Analysis of the 106 collections was completed on 5 October. The number of grid cells in which a taxon occurred is represented by the index 202 gFR (=20 km × 20 km grid Frequency Rate); this index essentially reflects the percentage of examined raster cells found to contain the potential vector in question. The 'snapshot' results can be summarised as follows:•A total of &gt;35,000 Culicoides were captured (μ = 333 midges/light trap) representing 16 species;•Not a single specimen of C. imicola, the principal Afro-Asiatic vector of BTV in southern Europe, was captured;•The three European species of Culicoides implicated previously as potential vectors in the Mediterranean region and the Balkans also occur in The Netherlands;•The Obsoletus Complex (represented by both potential vectors Culicoides obsoletus and Culicoides scoticus) was the most prevalent taxon (202 gFR: 93.4%) followed by the Pulicaris Complex (76.4%);•The Pulicaris Complex comprised at least six species. One of these, Culicoides pulicaris sensu stricto (ss), a potential vector in southern Europe, had a low 202 gFR of 17.9% indicating it played no role in the transmission of BTV;•The next most prevalent taxa were Culicoides dewulfi (70.8%) and Culicoides chiopterus (67.0%) both of which breed in cattle dung. This close association with livestock raises their potential as vectors of BTV;•Culicoides achrayi, Culicoides circumscriptus, C. dewulfi, Culicoides halophilus, Culicoides lupicaris and Culicoides stigma are new species records for The Netherlands and demonstrates that the extant knowledge on the Culicoides fauna of northern Europe is incomplete;•Cooling trends in the weather induced a &gt;50-fold decrease in overall Culicoides numbers but with subsequent warming these would rebound rapidly indicating that more intense cold is required before heightened mortalities are induced amongst adult biting midges. The northward advance of BT in Europe compels the competent authorities in affected and in neighbouring territories to acquire rapidly baseline information around which to plan sound vector surveillance and livestock movement strategies. The Culicoides 'snapshot' is a tool well suited to this purpose. It is stressed that a vector surveillance program must be built upon a firm taxonomic base because misidentifications will flaw the mapped seasonal and geographic distribution patterns upon which veterinary authorities depend. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In the recent years, USUTU virus (USUV), a flavivirus of the Japanese encephalitis virus complex, has been reported in Central Europe. As part of a systematic surveillance programme to monitor possible entrance and/or circulation of vector-borne viruses, since 2001, sentinel-chicken flocks were placed throughout the Italian territory nearby areas considered at risk of virus introduction. They have been periodically checked for the presence of antibodies against flaviviruses by indirect ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test for USUTU, West Nile and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. In July 2007, a sentinel chicken in a flock of 20 animals located within the Ravenna province seroconverted to USUV reaching neutralizing titres up to 1 : 5120. A second chicken seroconverted to the same virus 2 months later. Although no virus was rescued from these animals and from wild or farm birds sampled in the area, these results still provided evidence of the circulation of USUV in north-eastern Italy. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Small ruminants routine castration is carried out employing several methods. The most common are rubber ring (applied by elastrator), Burdizzo method, Rubber Ring + Burdizzo. Regrettably, the "knife castration" without anesthesia is still employed, too. Commonly accepted international welfare standards are frequently not respected. However, according to the method, animals experience different levels of stress. Several biochemical and behavioral indicators are available to quantify stress induced by the various castration methods and correlate procedures. The combined method (Rubber Ring + Burdizzo) was proven to be less painful than others. However, to minimize stress during small ruminants castration, it is necessary to improve present methods and look forward in order to find new painless ones. The employment of analgesics and local anesthesia is strongly recommended to further increase animal welfare during castration.},

abstract={Three hundred and ninety-seven randomly selected households were interviewed by telephone to determine the numbers and management of owned cats and dogs in the Teramo Province of Italy. The households were selected using stratified random sampling for each municipality; municipalities were combined into coastal, central hills and mountain regions for analysis. The interviews were completed during May and June of 2004 with a response rate of 74% (397/536). Forty-six percent of households (n = 181) owned pets; 15% of all households (n = 60) owned cats and 33% (n = 130) owned dogs. Twenty-seven of these households (7%) owned both cats and dogs. Data were provided on 91 cats evenly divided between males and females. The median age was 3 years (range 0.2-10 years). Forty-one percent of cats (36/87) entered the household as strays. Nearly half lived entirely outside. Seventy percent (62/88) had visited a veterinarian at least once; 43% (39/91) were sterilized. About 1/3 had had a litter and all litters were considered accidental rather than planned. Age, indoor/outdoor status, veterinarian visit and region were all associated with sterilization. Age, confined to a yard, veterinary visit and region were associated with allowing the cat to roam freely. Data were provided on 182 dogs. Sixty-two percent (113/181) were male, with a median age of 4 years (range newborn to 17 years) and 40% (72/181) were purebred. Almost half were acquired as a gift. Sixty-two percent (112/180) were kept entirely outside despite the fact that 82% (147/180) were considered companions rather than working dogs. Almost all of the dogs had been to a veterinarian at least once; only 20% (n = 29) were sterilized. Male dogs were significantly less likely to be sterilized than females. Almost half the dogs had had at least one litter. Seventy-six percent (137/180) of dogs knew some basic commands. Sex, source and training to sit/stay/come were significantly associated with whether the dog was sterilized. Dog size, confinement to a yard, trained to leash walk, veterinary visit and region were predictors of roaming freely. Source and trained to leash walk were associated with dog registration. For cats and dogs, education about sterilization seemed to be critically important. For dogs, factors relating to training, which may reflect the strength of the human-animal bond, were also important. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Immune response to Brucella abortus strain RB51 vaccine was measured in cattle vaccinated at calfhood. After an increase at day 6 post-vaccination (pv), the antibody level recorded in the 10 vaccinated animals remained constant for two months, and then progressively decreased. All vaccinated animals remained negative from day 162 pv to the end of the study (day 300 pv). Only at days 13 and 14 pv the RB51-CFT showed 100% sensitivity (credibility interval (CI) 76.2%-100%). The results indicate that the possibility to use RB51-CFT for the identification of cattle vaccinated at calfhood with RB51 is limited in time. A field investigation was carried out on 26,975 sera collected on regional basis from the Italian cattle population. The study outcomes indicate that in case of RB51-CFT positive results observed in officially Brucellosis-free (OBF) areas and, in any case, when an illegal use of RB51 vaccine is suspected, the use of the RB51-CFT alone is not sufficient to identify all the vaccinated animals. The design of a more sophisticated diagnostic protocol including an epidemiological investigation, the use of RB51-CFT, and the use of the skin test with RB51 as antigen is deemed more appropriate for the identification of RB51 vaccinated animals.

abstract={A cross-sectional telephone survey of randomly selected households examined the extent and types of problems associated with free-roaming dogs and cats in the Teramo province of Italy. The households were sampled randomly within each municipality; municipalities were combined into coastal, central hills and mountain regions for analysis. The survey was conducted in May and June of 2004 with a response rate of 74% (397/536). Ninety percent of respondents (N = 356) believed that free-roaming dogs and cats were a problem. They were most commonly concerned about personal safety, followed by animal welfare, public health and environmental sanitation. Sixty-nine percent of respondents (274) actually saw free-roaming dogs or cats where they live. While dogs were most commonly seen, cats were seen in greater numbers. Overall, 10% (39/297) and 5% (21/397) of respondents cared for free-roaming cats and dogs, respectively. Two-thirds of the respondents (251/397) believed that animals were abandoned because the owners lost interest. About 2/3 of respondents (251/397) reported that the community government should have the responsibility for dealing with free-roaming dogs and cats. The respondents supported the idea of building more shelters and controlling the birth rate as control measures rather than euthanizing dogs and cats. The results suggest that free-roaming dogs and cats are a very common sight in this part of Italy with substantial concerns by the residents. However, concerns about the animals' welfare were clearly raised, supporting the laws that make it illegal to euthanize a healthy dog or cat in Italy. Using the information from this study, research on the underlying causes of abandonment of dogs and cats or failing to sterilize them should be undertaken to begin to address this problem. Further, national and regional funding must be provided to support existing laws which should help protect and eventually decrease the numbers of free-roaming and homeless dogs and cats. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A recent issue in the EU legislation is the evaluation of the toxicologically-equivalent contribution of dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (DL-PCBs) in addition to that coming from polychlorodibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorodibenzofurans (PCDFs) as contaminants in foods for a total of 29 congeners. This fact is determining the need to revise analytical criteria both for confirmatory and screening analysis. In this work, a modeling was developed to check the reliability of the outcomes of the DR CALUX® bioassay when applied to farm milk samples characterized by large differences in congener patterns. To reproduce some field conditions where DL-PCB contributions up to 90% of total WHO-TEQs (HRGC-HRMS assessment) were recorded in dairy products, goat milk samples from a common bulk were fortified at different TEQ levels with mixtures containing either PCDDs and PCDFs or non-ortho substituted DL-PCBs. Fortification ranged approximately 4.5-15 pgWHO-TEQ/g fat. Based on the results, DR CALUX® relative potency value (REP) of DL-PCB 126 was estimated 0.061 against the canonical WHO-TEF of 0.1. The value of 0.061 together with the other DR CALUX® REPs from the literature for the remaining 28 congeners were used to model DR CALUX® response (C-TEQs) in milk samples with different congener patterns. The theoretical underestimation of DR CALUX® data could be mitigated by correcting the latter with the linear correlation experimentally obtained between C-TEQs and the WHO-TEQs. Under these conditions, the use as calibrants of reference samples with different analytical patterns could help those laboratories involved in a high throughput routine to set the most appropriate decision limits to optimize screening output. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={We analysed 33 brown bears from the Romanian Carpathians and the Italian Apennines at sequences of the mitochondrial control region and nine polymorphic microsatellite loci with regard to genetic variability and haplotype distribution. The Italian brown bears were monomorphic for mtDNA sequences. The Romanian bears yielded the highest variability found so far in this species. Haplotypes of both previously identified mtDNA lineages (western and eastern) were found in Romania. In the eastern part of the Carpathians western and eastern haplotypes occurred sympatrically, the bears from the western part of the mountain range only exhibited western-type sequences. This pattern provides evidence of a mitochondrial phylogeographic break in the distribution of the eastern lineage within the Romanian Carpathians. Conservation implications of this finding are discussed. © 2007 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.},

abstract={After the incursion of bluetongue virus (BTV) into European Mediterranean countries in 1998, vaccination was used in an effort to minimize direct economic losses to animal production, reduce virus circulation and allow safe movements of animals from endemic areas. Vaccination strategies in different countries were developed according to their individual policies, the geographic distribution of the incurring serotypes of BTV and the availability of appropriate vaccines. Four monovalent modified live virus (MLV) vaccines were imported from South Africa and subsequently used extensively in both cattle and sheep. MLVs were found to be immunogenic and capable of generating strong protective immunity in vaccinated ruminants. Adverse side effects were principally evident in sheep. Specifically, some vaccinated sheep developed signs of clinical bluetongue with fever, facial oedema and lameness. Lactating sheep that developed fever also had reduced milk production. More severe clinical signs occurred in large numbers of sheep that were vaccinated with vaccine combinations containing the BTV-16 MLV, and the use of the monovalent BTV-16 MLV was discontinued as a consequence. Abortion occurred in <0.5% of vaccinated animals. The length of viraemia in sheep and cattle that received MLVs did not exceed 35 days, with the single notable exception of a cow vaccinated with a multivalent BTV-2, -4, -9 and -16 vaccine in which viraemia persisted at least 78 days. Viraemia of sufficient titre to infect Culicoides insects was observed transiently in MLV-vaccinated ruminants, and natural transmission of MLV strains has been confirmed. An inactivated vaccine was first developed against BTV-2 and used in the field. An inactivated vaccine against BTV-4 as well as a bivalent vaccine against serotypes 2 and 4 were subsequently developed and used in Corsica, Spain, Portugal and Italy. These inactivated vaccines were generally safe although on few occasions reactions occurred at the site of inoculation. Two doses of these BTV inactivated vaccines provided complete, long-lasting immunity against both clinical signs and viraemia, whereas a single immunization with the BTV-4 inactivated vaccine gave only partial reduction of viraemia in vaccinated cattle when challenged with the homologous BTV serotype. Additional BTV inactivated vaccines are currently under development, as well as new generation vaccines including recombinant vaccines. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Since 2000 severe, long-lasting epidemics of bluetongue virus (BTV) have been described in Italy, caused by BTV serotypes 2, 4, 9 and 16. Vaccination programs have been applied extensively to control the infection, in spite of concerns about the potential dissemination of attenuated vaccine strains of BTV in susceptible animals. Accordingly, rapid and reliable differentiation between vaccine and field strains is paramount in routine diagnosis of BTV to evaluate the extent of this phenomenon. In the present study, we report the development of two real-time RT-PCR assays able to recognise BTV serotypes 2 and 9, respectively, and we evaluated the use of the assays for discrimination between field and vaccine strains. A total of 65 samples collected in Italy from 2000 to 2006 and diagnosed as positive for either BTV-2 or -9 were analysed by the TaqMan assays. Both the assays were found to be highly sensitive and reproducible, ensuring correct serotype characterisation and prediction of the origin of the strains, as confirmed by characterisation using virus neutralisation and sequencing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

WNV was isolated from blood and organs samples of one horse, one donkey, one pigeon (Columba livia) and three magpies (Pica pica). The phylogenetic analysis of the isolates, conducted on 255 bp in the region coding for the E protein, indicates that these isolates belong to the lineage I among the European strains.

abstract={Many species of Vibrio are responsible for diseases in marine organisms and for economic losses to the aquaculture industry. The aim of this preliminary study was to obtain species-specific DNA zones to be used as potential probes from a phylogenetic analysis of the 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of different Vibrio species from marine and human organisms. Species-specific probes were identified for V. parahaemolyticus, V. fortis, V. splendidus, and for two clusters of taxonomically related species, namely V. harveyi/campbelli and V. lentus/aestuarianus. A reverse line blot assay showed that the designed probes can specifically detect the different Vibrio species, thereby proving that these probes can be used to evaluate the presence of pathogenic and nonpathogenic Vibrio species in the sea and in marine organisms to assist in the investigation of environmental risks. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Red deer (n = 149) from eight geographical locations, including the endangered endemic populations from the Tyrrhenian islands (Sardinia and Corsica), were analysed at eight polymorphic microsatellite loci. Two questions were addressed: (1) Is there a founder effect in the Corsican population, which was reintroduced to the island using Sardinian deer after the species' extinction on Corsica? (2) What is the origin of the Tyrrhenian or Corsican red deer (Cervus elaphus corsicanus)? Our results showed signs of a founder effect for the red deer on Corsica in that these deer showed differentiation from the Sardinian population as measured by FST values, assignment tests (with and without a priori definition of populations) and individual-based dendrograms. Genetic variability, however, did not differ significantly between the two populations. With respect to the phylogeography of C. e. corsicanus we found that both deer from North-Africa and Mesola on the Italian mainland were genetically close to the Corsican red deer, but phylogenetic trees based on genetic distances were only poorly supported statistically. Among all populations studied the Mesola red deer showed the lowest distance values from Corsican red deer and yielded allele frequencies that were more similar to those of C. e. corsicanus than were those of North-African red deer. These results are in line with recent palaeontological and archaeozoological findings which suggest that the Corsican red deer is derived from small Italian red deer introduced from the mainland to Sardinia and Corsica during the Late Neolithic and just before the beginning of Classical Antiquity, respectively. They also suggest a possible recent introduction of Tyrrhenian red deer to North-Africa (rather than the other way around), thus accounting for the close genetic relationship (especially based on mitochondrial DNA) that has repeatedly been found between C. e. corsicanus and C. e. barbarus. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the genes (S10) encoding the NS3 protein of 137 strains of bluetongue virus (BTV) from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and the Mediterranean Basin showed limited variation. Common to all NS3 sequences were potential glycosylation sites at amino acid residues 63 and 150 and a cysteine at residue 137, whereas a cysteine at residue 181 was not conserved. The PPXY and PS/TAP late-domain motifs were conserved in all but three of the viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of these same sequences yielded two principal clades that grouped the viruses irrespective of their serotype or year of isolation (1900-2003). All viruses from Asia and Australia were grouped in one clade, whereas those from the other regions were present in both clades. Each clade segregated into distinct subclades that included viruses from single or multiple regions, and the S10 genes of some field viruses were identical to those of live-attenuated BTV vaccines. There was no evidence of positive selection on the S10 gene as assessed by reconstruction of ancestral codon states on the phylogeny, rather the functional constraints of the NS3 protein are expressed through substantial negative (purifying) selection. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Culicoides, Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is the principal vector of bluetongue virus (BTV) to ruminant livestock in southern Europe. The secondary potential vectors are Culicoides obsoletus (Meigen) and Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle of the Obsoletus Complex, Culicoides pulicaris (Linnaeus) of the Pulicaris Complex and Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer of the subgenus Avaritia Fox. Between 2000 and 2004 >38,000 light-trap collections were made for Culicoides across Italy including the islands of Sardinia and Sicily. Mapping of the 100 largest collections of C. imicola and of the Obsoletus Complex showed them to be disjunct overlapping in only 2% of the 200 municipalities selected. For each municipality the average values were calculated for minimum temperature, aridity index, altitude, terrain slope, normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and percentage forest cover. A factor analysis identified two principal factors ('biotic' and 'abiotic') and explained 84% of the total variability; a discriminant analysis classified correctly 87.5% of the observations. The results indicate adult populations of C. imicola to occur in more sparsely vegetated habitats that are exposed to full sunlight, whereas species of the Obsoletus Complex favour a more shaded habitat, with increased green leaf density. Heliophily and umbrophily, by shortening or lengthening the respective adult life cycles of these two vectors, will likely impact on the ability of each to transmit BTV and is discussed in the light of the current outbreak of BTV across the Mediterranean Basin. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A spreadsheet population dynamics model was constructed to evaluate the impact of female dog sterilization on the domestic dog population for the province of Teramo, Italy. Baseline owned dog population structure as well as the annual number of births, adoptions, abandonments, and purchases were estimated based on regional managed kennel data in addition to a telephone questionnaire administered to members of the local population. Age- and gender-dependent death rates were based on domestic dog life tables. The model predicts that at the current female dog sterilization rate of 30%, the owned dog population will most probably continue to increase. After 20 years, a mean annual increase of 2.6% (median: 2.5%, 95% CI: -3.2% to 8.8%) is projected assuming that the average age at sterilization is 3 years. A sterilization rate of at least 55% is estimated to be needed to halt population growth if the current age structure for female dog sterilization is maintained. However, if the province of Teramo were to focus on sterilizing female dogs less than 1 year of age, the required sterilization rate to arrest population growth could be reduced to as low as 26%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The contribution of science to farm level disease management is a story of two worlds. The development of effective vaccines has allowed for the control of important salmonid diseases such as furunculosis, yersiniosis and vibriosis and has significantly reduced farmers' reliance on antibiotics. Control of diseases for which cost-effective vaccines have yet to be developed has been achieved through the development of increasingly targeted antibiotics and chemotherapeutants. Increasingly, accurate and rapid diagnostic and water quality tests have allowed farmers to improve farm-level aquatic animal health management. In developed countries, these achievements have been possible thanks to the strong link between science and farm management. This link has been assisted by the presence of strong farmer organizations capable of coordinating research projects and hosting meetings at which scientific information is discussed and disseminated. Although Asia is responsible for the production of about 90% of aquaculture products, it presents a rather different picture from the above. Science has indeed made significant progress in health management but the links with farm management are still weak. Management practices capable of preventing important health problems in shrimp and fish fanning are still poorly adopted by farmers. This is largely due to constraints in the dissemination of information to the large number of producers involved, the limited resources of both producers and their countries and the lack of effective farmer organizations capable of liaising with the scientific world. Recently, the Asian region has witnessed some successful examples of aquatic animal health management through the adoption of simple Better Management Practices. Efforts so far have been largely focused on shrimp farming, although activities have been initiated to adopt a similar approach to other commodities. The need for both observational and experimental epidemiological studies to identify simple and affordable farm practices for the control of aquatic animal diseases is highlighted.},

abstract={Prevention is essential in order to fight against disease propagation and their consequences, in particular because curative methods are less efficient in the open and marine environment. Modelling as a predictive tool is in this case particularly accurate. A bibliographic review of published models in aquatic health was made for the European project DIPNET. Quantitative risk assessment is made for some diseases of salmonids of north European countries, in order to protect transfers, to make risk-based surveillance, and to prevent from emerging diseases. Dynamic models have begun to be used for risk management, for salmonids and shellfish (USA) but are depending on their complexity, data- and time-consuming. Dynamic models are, however, necessary for evaluating the effects of measures predictively, with a complex system of causality. Classical rigorous epidemiologic studies are not numerous in aquatic health, however they are of particular interest for risk management of health problems. For aquatic animal health, there are few models that take into account spatial analysis, economic or ecologic consequences. This is surprising because of the strong well-known interactions between the host and environment in aquatic systems, and because of the interest for the risk manager. Modelling work needs multidisciplinary skills, which are sometimes difficult to share for aquatic productions.},

abstract={Histamine formation in Sardina pilchardus and Engraulis encrasicolus as a function of storage temperature was studied. Fish were caught off the Adriatic Coast and were carried immediately to the laboratory. A portion of dorsal muscle from each fish was soon analyzed, while two other portions were examined after storage at two different temperatures (25 and 4C) for 24 and 72 h, respectively. The analyses were carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-UV and confirmed by HPLC-diode array detector. Histamine concentrations were always higher than the European Community admissible levels in samples stored at 25C. In fish stored at 4C, histamine was detected only in E. encrasicolus. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS Time experiments were conducted to quantify the histamine formation in scombroid species at two different temperatures. The first assay (24 h, 25C) could reproduce the modality of sale adopted by fishermen or retailers in summer on the one hand, and the maintenance at ambient temperature of semipreserved sardines or anchovies during salting and ripening on the other hand. The second experiment (72 h, 4C) was based on the domestic cold preservation of fish before the consumption, which sometimes occurs some days after purchasing. Even if ice storage is recommended, time/temperature abuse conditions often occur in the fish merchandising chain. The results of this research showed that high histamine concentrations could be found in the analyzed species not only at an abused temperature, but also at a common storage temperature of fish at home. © 2007, Blackwell Publishing.},

Seventy-eight days after the first vaccination, all sheep were inoculated subcutaneously with a suspension containing 106.3 TCID50 of a virulent reference BTV-16 isolate. Apart from a transient inflammatory reaction at the injection site, no adverse effects were reported following vaccination. All vaccinated animals developed high titres (7.3-9.3 log2(ED50%/50 μl)) of virus-specific neutralising antibodies and were resistant to challenge with BTV-16.

abstract={Risk analysis has only been regularly used in the management of aquatic animal health in recent years. The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures (SPS) stimulated the application of risk analysis to investigate disease risks associated with international trade (import risk analysis-IRA). A majority (9 of 17) of the risk analyses reviewed were IRA. The other major focus has been the parasite of Atlantic salmon-Gyrodactylus salaris. Six studies investigated the spread of this parasite, between countries, rivers and from farmed to wild stocks, and clearly demonstrated that risk analysis can support aquatic animal health policy development, from international trade and biosecurity to disease interaction between wild and farmed stocks. Other applications of risk analysis included the spread of vertically transmitted pathogens and disease emergence in aquaculture. The Covello-Merkhofer, risk analysis model was most commonly used and appears to be a flexible tool not only for IRA but also the investigation of disease spread in other contexts. The limitations of the identified risk assessments were discussed. A majority were qualitative, partly due to the lack of data for quantitative analysis, and this, it can be argued, constrained their usefulness for trade purposes (i.e. setting appropriate sanitary measures); in other instances, a qualitative result was found to be adequate for decision making. A lack of information about the disease hazards of the large number of fish species traded is likely to constrain quantitative analysis for a number of years. The consequence assessment element of a risk analysis was most likely to be omitted, or limited in scope and depth, rarely extending beyond examining the evidence of susceptibility of farmed and wild species to the identified hazard. The reasons for this are discussed and recommendations made to develop guidelines for a consistent, systematic and multi-disciplinary approach to consequence assessment. Risk analysis has improved decision making in aquatic animal health management by providing a transparent method for using the available scientific information. The lack of data is the main constraint to the application of risk analysis in aquatic animal health. The identification of critical parameters is an important output from risk analysis models which should be used to prioritise research. © 2007.},

abstract={Veterinary drugs residue monitoring is enforced in the EU according to requirements set down in EU Directive 96/23/EC and Commission Decision 97/747/EC; the number of samples to be collected yearly is essentially defined according to production data. The present study aimed to quantitatively estimate the general contamination level of Italian poultry meat by some veterinary drug residues. A sampling plan was designed according to statistical considerations; study results were extrapolated to the general population by means of Bayesian analysis. Only one positive sample, contaminated by sulfonamides, was detected; this low contamination level (0.33%) is very close to the percentage of violative samples detected by the Italian National Residue Plans (NRP) in the period 1995-2001 (<0.5%). This result, however, was achieved more effectively and at a lower cost than data obtained within NRP's design and requirements. The study indicated also that statistically based residue monitoring plans ensure better protection levels for consumers, than control systems designed simply as a proportion of production units. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A simple and rapid multiplexed sandwich chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes. To achieve the multiplexed detection of the four pathogens, a new polystyrene 96 well microtiter plate format has been designed, in which each main well contains four subwells in the bottom. The monoclonal antibodies specific for each bacteria were separately immobilized in each subwell. When the samples were added to the main wells, the bacteria able to specifically bind to the corresponding monoclonal antibody were captured in one of the four subwells. Subsequently, a mixture of peroxidase-labeled polyclonal antibodies against the four bacteria was added and the peroxidase activity of the bound polyclonal labeled antibodies in each well was measured by an enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescent cocktail using a low-light charge-coupled imaging device. The assay was simple and fast, and the limit of quantification was in the order of 104-105 CFU/mL for all bacterial species. The accuracy of the method, evaluated by comparison of the results with a conventional culturing methodology, was satisfactory, with recovery values ranging from 90 to 120%. This method can be used as a screening test to evaluate the presence of these pathogen bacteria in different foodstuffs. © 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Information on population parameters is rarely collected from carcasses. This method can be particularly useful - with limitations - when protected species are involved (e.g. the grey wolf Canis lupus in Italy). Local data on population structure, reproduction, survivorship and causes of mortality are necessary to build reliable conservation models to assess the state of a population and to predict its evolution. On the other hand, 'best guesses' or data from ecologically different areas have often been used to build population viability analysis and other conservation-oriented models. A sample of 154 wolf carcasses was found, collected and analysed from 1991 to 2001 in central-eastern Italy, the historic core of the wolf distribution range. Collision with a vehicle was the main cause of death in both sexes; however, road kills may be biased with a greater detectability, and we treated our data accordingly. Road kills were concentrated on the younger (≤4 years old) age classes, whereas fully adult wolves died mainly because of poaching, intraspecific strife and pathologies. Cubs and subadults (≤2 years old) showed a mortality peak in November/December, at the beginning of the dispersal period, whereas adults died mainly in January/February (mating season). The population structure of our sample of wolf carcasses appeared to be well balanced, although perinatal and cub mortality was underestimated. The sex ratio was 1:1 in the younger age classes and 1:0.7 in the older age classes. Only 20.7% of females, 2-6 years old, showed signs of reproduction; placental scar and embryo number varied from one to seven (mean, 4.4) per individual. Survivorship theoretical curves indicated a fair survival of cubs and subadults, but a steep decline as wolves approached maximum life span (9 years old). Our data and other published data on food habits and genetic features of the wolf in central-eastern Italy suggest that, despite ongoing heavy human-induced losses, this predator has fully recovered in the last 30 years from the brink of extinction. © 2007 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={We describe the development and preliminary characterization of a recombinant canarypox virus vectored vaccine for protective immunization of ruminants against bluetongue virus (BTV) infection. Sheep (n = 6) immunized with recombinant canarypox virus vector (BTV-CP) co-expressing synthetic genes encoding the two outer capsid proteins (VP2 and VP5) of BTV serotype 17 (BTV-17) developed high titers (40-160) of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies and were resistant to challenge with a field strain of BTV-17. In contrast, sheep (n = 5) immunized with a commercial recombinant canarypox virus vector expressing the E and preM genes of West Nile virus were seronegative to BTV and developed pyrexia, lymphopenia, and extended, high-titered viremias following challenge exposure to the field strain of BTV-17. These data confirm that the BTV-CP vaccine may be useful for the protective immunization of ruminants against bluetongue, and it may avoid the problems inherent to live-attenuated (LA) BTV vaccines. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The viruses causing the economically important livestock diseases of African horse sickness (AHS) and bluetongue (BT) are transmitted by biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae). In the Old World the most important vectors of these diseases are Culicoides imicola Kieffer, 1913, Culicoides brevitarsis Kieffer, 1917 and Culicoides bolitinos Meiswinkel, 1989. All three of these vectors belong to the Imicola complex of the subgenus Avaritia Fox, 1955. This species complex now comprises 12 sibling species; ten occur in sub-Saharan Africa and are difficult to identify (based mostly on subtle variations in the wing patterns) and so additional methods of reliable identification are needed. The pupal exuviae of the five commonest sibling species (C. imicola, C. bolitinos, Culicoides loxodontis Meiswinkel, 1992, Culicoides tuttifrutti Meiswinkel, Cornet & Dyce, 2003 and Culicoides sp. # 107) harvested from a variety of large herbivore dung types and from decaying fruits, are described and illustrated in detail. It is shown that they can be differentiated clearly on a number of morphological characters and, furthermore, are separable into two distinct groups based (principally) on the shape of the respiratory organ. A key for identifying and differentiating these five pupae is provided. Also, the pupa of the Oriental-Australasian C. brevitarsis was compared with its allopatric sister taxon, C. bolitinos. Because they share a common larval habitat (cattle and buffalo dung) and are almost inseparable in the adult phenotype, the question of their possible synonymy is raised. However, their respective pupae could not be differentiated on gross morphology and so it is argued that this unresolved problem requires a molecular solution.},

abstract={Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), caused by Mycoplasma mycoides var. mycoides small colony (MmmSC), is one of the most important diseases of cattle in Africa. The role of innate or acquired cell mediated and humoral immunity in conferring protection against MmmSC infection has not yet been elucidated. On the other hand, the pathological lesions caused by the aetiological agent have been considered indicative of an immunopathological process. In this study ten naïve cattle were exposed to in-contact infection with animals infected by intubation with a strain of MmmSC. Clinical signs, antibody response, IFNγ release and pathological changes at necropsy were analysed and compared with the events following in-contact infection of an equal number of animals kept under daily treatment with cyclosporine for the entire observation period of 84 days. Cyclosporine is a suppressor of the immune response related to the T-cell system. Under the conditions of the experiment, cyclosporine appeared to condition the pathogenesis of CBPP by delaying the events that follow infection, bringing further support to the possibility that the immune response may have an impact on the disease outcome.},

abstract={The rationale for establishing trade 'regions' and 'zones' is based on principles of epidemiological science and risk analysis that assess and manage animal disease risks so that the safety of trade can be ensured. However, the boundaries of geographical regions and zones may readily be breached through numerous epidemiological pathways. The concept of a 'compartment' extends the application of a 'risk boundary' beyond that of a geographical interface and considers all epidemiological factors that can contribute to the creation of an effective boundary. The fundamental requirement for application of either concept (regions/zones or compartments) is that the population considered for trade is maintained within management or geographical boundaries which allow clear epidemiological differentiation to be made between those animals and surrounding populations of higher risk. Seven factors are presented that an exporting country might use to guide the identification and documentation of a compartment. Additionally, the steps that would be undertaken to implement trade based on the compartmentalisation concept are discussed.},

abstract={Bluetongue virus (BTV) is the causative agent of Bluetongue (BT) disease in ruminant livestock and occurs almost worldwide between latitudes 35°S and 50°N; 24 serotypes of BTV are known of which 8 circulate periodically within parts of the Mediterranean Region. A fast (about 3.5 h) and versatile diagnostic procedure able to detect and quantify BTV-RNA, has been developed using a Molecular Beacon (MB) fluorescent probe; PCR primers were designed to target 91 bp within the NS3 conserved region of the viral RNA segment 10 (S10) and bracketed the MB fluorescence probe hybridisation site. The MB fluorescent probe was used to develop two Bluetongue serogroup-specific assays: a quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and a traditional RT-PCR. These were tested using BTV-RNAs extracted from the blood and organs of BT-affected animals, and from virus isolate suspensions. The samples included ten serotypes (BTV-1-BTV-9 and BTV-16); of these, BTV serotypes -1, -2, -4, -9 and -16 have since 1998 been involved in the extensive outbreaks of BT across the Mediterranean Region. To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the MB probe, all positive samples (and negative controls) were tested using the developed quantitative real time RT-PCR and traditional RT-PCR assays. The former test had a detection limit of 103 cDNA molecules per reaction with a log-linear quantification range of up to 1011 (R2 = 0.98), while the latter test was able to detect 500 cDNA-BTV molecules/PCR. The results show that the MB fluorescent probe is both rapid and versatile for the laboratory diagnosis of Bluetongue and for quantifying levels of viraemia in BTV-affected animals. An "in silico" comparison of the primers and MB fluorescent probe used in this study showed that it is possible to detect all 24 serotypes of BTV. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Thirteen orf virus isolates obtained during the time period between 1995 and 2004 from crusted scab lesions of nine sheep and four goats from different geographical areas of Greece and Italy with suspected contagious ecthyma infection were analyzed. DNA of all isolates was successfully amplified by PCR with the primers 045F-045R and identified them as parapox virus. Partial DNA sequence of orf virus interferon resistant (VIR) gene, phylogenetic analysis of the available isolates and amino acid comparison of the interferon resistance protein encoded by this genomic region was carried out. According to the results of the present report a precise characterisation of the genomic region studied might provide evidence for the genetic variation and movement of the circulating orf virus strains. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In August 2000, bluetongue virus (BTV) appeared for the first time in Sardinia and, since then, the infection spread across Sicily and into the mainland of Italy involving at the beginning serotypes 2 and 9 and then, from 2002, 4 and 16. To reduce direct losses due to disease and indirect losses due to new serotype circulation, the 2004 Italian vaccination campaign included the modified-live vaccines against BTV-4 and 16 produced by Onderstepoort Biological Product (OBP), South Africa. Few months after the end of the campaign, BTV-16 was reported broadly in the country and the need of differentiating field from the BTV-16 vaccine isolate became crucial. In this study, the gene segments 2, 5, 6 and 10 of both the Italian and vaccine BTV-16 strains were sequenced and their molecular relationship determined. As sequences of segment 5 were those showing the highest differences (17.3%), it was possible to develop a new diagnostic tool able to distinguish the Italian BTV-16 NS1 gene from that of the homologous vaccine strain. The procedure based on the use of a RT-PCR and the subsequent sequencing of the amplified product showed a high degree of sensitivity and specificity when samples from either BTV-16 vaccinated or infected sheep were tested. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Red deer Cervus elaphus of the endangered populations from Sardinia and Mesola Wood, northern Italy, were analysed for genetic variation at 531 bp of the mitochondrial control region and 12 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted including additional data from the literature to gain insight into the phylogeographical origin of the Sardinian subspecies C. e. corsicanus. Microsatellite variation was low in both populations but Sardinia showed comparatively high variability at the control region. Management recommendations are discussed. In particular, the Mesola red deer, the only remaining indigenous Italian population, ought to be managed to increase the effective population size and should be subdivided into two or more populations. As to the phylogeography of the Sardinian population, microsatellite data favoured mainland Italy as the place of origin in that Sardinia and Mesola showed the smallest distance values and were paired together in trees with high bootstrap support. However, the mitochondrial data only partially confirmed this conclusion but showed great similarity between Sardinian and Spanish red deer. Possible explanations for this discrepancy and general limits of mitochondrial sequences in resolving demographic and biogeographical processes of the recent past are discussed. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). The expression of the JSRV envelope (Env) alone is sufficient to transform a variety of cell lines in vitro and induce lung cancer in immunodeficient mice. In order to determine the role of the JSRV Env in OPA tumorigenesis in sheep, we derived a JSRV replication-defective virus (JS-RD) which expresses env under the control of its own long terminal repeat (LTR). JS-RD was produced by transiently transfecting 293T cells with a two plasmid system, involving (i) a packaging plasmid, with the putative JSRV packaging signal deleted, expressing the structural and enzymatic proteins Gag, Pro, and Pol, and (ii) a plasmid which expresses env in trans for JS-RD particles and provides the genomes necessary to deliver JSRV env upon infection. During the optimization of the JS-RD system we determined that both R-US (in the viral 5′ LTR) and the env region are important for JSRV particle production. Two independent experimental transmission studies were carried out with newborn lambs. Four of five lambs inoculated with JS-RD showed OPA lesions in the lungs at various times between 4 and 12 months postinoculation. Abundant expression of JSRV Env was detected in tumor cells of JS-RD-infected animals and PCR assays confirmed the presence of the deleted JS-RD genome. These data strongly suggest that the JSRV Env functions as a dominant oncoprotein in the natural immunocompetent host and that JSRV can induce OPA in the absence of viral spread.

The virus was grown on Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK 21 ) cells, and the supernatant was purified by filtration and inactivated with β-propriolactone. The inactivated product was checked according to the NHI and European Pharmacopoeia methods. Part of the product was then lyophilised and the other part was adjuvanted with Al(OH) 3 . Both parts were used to vaccinate and boost groups of horses, cattle and sheep at different intervals. Their immunogenicity was compared with a similar commercial product. Blood samples were collected on a regular basis and the antibody titre was determined by the Fluorescence Antibody Virus Neutralisation (FAVN) test. No significant differences were found between species after both inoculations even though the immune response increased in intensity and duration after the booster dose in all the animals tested and was stronger and lasted longer with the adjuvanted aliquot.},

abstract={Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) include vectors for the economically important animal diseases, bluetongue (BT) and African horse sickness (AHS). In the Mediterranean Basin, these diseases are transmitted by four species of Culicoides: the first three belong in the subgenus Avaritia Fox and are Culicoides imicola Kieffer, Culicoides obsoletus (Meigen) and Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle; the fourth is Culicoides pulicaris (Linnaeus) in the subgenus Culicoides Latreille. In the Palaearctic Region, this subgenus (usually referred to as the C. pulicaris group) now includes a loose miscellany of some 50 taxa. The lack of clarity surrounding its taxonomy stimulated the present morphological and molecular study of 11 species collected in Italy. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence variation demonstrated a high degree of divergence. These results, combined with those from a parallel morphological study, disclosed: (1) that some previously described taxa should be resurrected from synonymy; (2) that there are new species to be described; (3) that the subgenus Culicoides (as currently employed) is a polyphyletic assemblage of four lineages - the subgenus Culicoides sensu stricto, the subgenus Silvicola Mirzaeva and Isaev, the subgenus Hoffmania Fox and the hitherto unrecognized Fagineus species complex. Each is discussed briefly (but not defined) and its constituent Palaearctic taxa listed. Strong congruence between morphological and molecular data holds promise for resolving many of the difficult taxonomic issues plaguing the accurate identification of vector Culicoides around the world. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={The extant taxa of central and northern Europe are commonly believed to derive from Pleistocene ancestors, who moved to the north from three separate glacial refugia: the Iberian and Italian peninsulae, as well as the southern Balkans. The issue of postglacial dispersal patterns was addressed through the investigation of population structure and phylogeography of the European roe deer, Capreolus capreolus. The genetic diversity in 376 individuals representing 14 allegedly native populations across their European range was assessed, using ten autosomal microsatellite loci and restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the mitochondrial D-loop and NADH dehydrogenase 1 gene segments. Our results suggest the existence of three major genetic lineages of roe deer in Europe. One comprises populations in the south-western limit of the species' distribution (i.e. Iberia), where an internal substructure splits a northern from a southern sublineage. A second lineage includes populations of southern and eastern Europe, as well as a separate sublineage sampled in central-southern Italy, where the existence of the subspecies Capreolus c. italicus was supported. In central-northern Europe, a third lineage is present, which appeared genetically rather homogeneous, although admixed, and equally divergent from both the eastern and western lineages. Current patterns of intraspecific genetic variation suggest that postglacial recolonization routes of this cervid to northern Europe could be due to range expansion from one or more refugia in central-eastern Europe, rather than proceeding from the Mediterranean areas. © 2006 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of bluetongue virus (BTV) in blood samples. A combination of primers specific for a highly conserved region in RNA segment 5 (based on Mediterranean BTV sequences) and a DNA probe bound to 5′-Taq nuclease-3′ minor groove binder (TaqMan© MGB) was used to detect a range of isolates. This real-time RT-PCR assay could detect 5.4 × 10 -3 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) of virus per milliliter of sample, which was comparable to our current BTV diagnostic nested RT-PCR assay. The assay detected all recent Mediterranean isolates (including serotypes 2, 4, and 16), BTV vaccine strains for serotypes 2 and 4, and 15 out of the 24 BTV reference strains available (all serotypes), but did not detect the related orbiviruses epizootic hemorrhagic disease and African horse sickness viruses. Following assay evaluation, the ability of this assay to identify BTV in recent isolates (2003, 2004) from ovine and bovine samples from an epizootic outbreak in Spain was also tested. Minor nucleotide changes (detected by sequencing viral genomes) within the probe-binding region were found to have a profound effect on virus detection. This assay has the benefits of being fast and simple, and the 96-well format enables large-scale epidemiological screening for BTV, especially when combined with a high-throughput nucleic acid extraction method.},

abstract={The precise role of bovine interferon-γ (BoIFN-γ) in disease and therapy is still poorly defined. Clearly it is involved in defence against parasites, bacteria, viruses and possibly tumor cells. This paper reports the expression of BoIFN-γ in a baculovirus system to generate a fully functional recombinant protein. Bovine interferon-γ cDNA was cloned from mitogen stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA utilizing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cDNA open reading frame (ORF) encoding for a putative 166 amino acid protein (22KDa) was cloned and expressed into baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac 4.5/V5 His. This vector was co-transfected with Autografa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) DNA into Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) and the recombinant virus, named AcBoIFN-γ, was then recovered. Recombinant BoIFN-γ (rBoIFN-γ His) was accumulated in the serum-free medium of AcBoIFN-γ-infected cells. The nickel affinity spin column purified rBoIFN-γ His was shown to be a glycosylated 20-22 KDa protein as confirmed by SDS-PAGE glycan determination and showed antiviral activity in vitro against the bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease virus (BVD/MD). The production of this bioactive rBoIFN-γ His will allow us to explore this cytokine as a potential vaccine adjuvant or therapeutic agent for bovine diseases.},

abstract={Many synthetic chemicals, termed xenoestrogens, have been shown to interact as agonists with the estrogen receptor (ER) to elicit biological responses similar to those of natural hormones. To date, the regulation of vitellogenesis in oviparous vertebrates has been widely used for evaluation of estrogenic effects. Therefore, Carassius auratus juveniles were chosen as a fish model for studying the effects of estradiol-17β and different concentrations (10 -6 and 10-7 M) of 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) on the expression of liver ERβ-1 subtype; plasma vitellogenin and sex steroids (androgens and estradiol-17β) were also evaluated together with the bioaccumulation process, through mass-spectrometry. C. auratus is a species widespread in the aquatic environment and, on the toxicological point of view, can be considered a good "sentinel" species. Juveniles of goldfish were maintained in tanks with only tap water or water with different concentrations (10 -6 and 10-7 M) of 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), or 10-7 M of estradiol-17β. After 3 weeks of treatment, animals were anesthetized within 5 min after capture, and blood was immediately collected into heparinized syringes by cardiac puncture and stored at -70 °C; the gonads were fixed, then frozen and stored at -70 °C; the whole fish, liver, and muscle tissues were harvested and immediately stored at -70 °C for molecular biology experiments and bioaccumulation measurements. The estrogenic effects of 4-NP were evidenced by the presence of plasma vitellogenin in juveniles exposed both to estradiol-17β and the two doses of 4-NP; moreover, exposure to 4-NP also increased aromatization of androgens, as suggested by decreasing androgens and increasing estradiol-17β plasma levels. The changes of these parameters were in agreement with the increasing transcriptional rate of ERβ-1 mRNA in the liver, demonstrating that both estradiol-17β and 4-NP modulate the vitellogenin rate through interaction with the ERβ-1 subtype. The present study also suggests that 4-NP at the concentration of 10-6 M bioaccumulates in the liver. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The incursion of bluetongue (BT) in Italy, in August 2000, caused heavy economic losses, partly due to the direct effect of the disease on the animals, but mostly due to indirect losses due to ruminant movement restrictions conducive to heavy losses to the cattle and sheep industry. To limit losses due to both disease and virus circulation, which was the cause of movement restrictions, the Italian Ministry of Health in May 2001 ordered the vaccination of animals of all domestic ruminant species in infected and «at risk» areas. The vaccination strategy derived from a risk assessment that suggested that the vaccination of all domestic ruminants could reduce both direct losses and virus circulation significantly. The different levels of vaccination coverage, achieved in the various regions of Italy, had clear consequences on the spread of both disease and infection. In regions where more than 80% of the target populations were vaccinated properly, the disease disappeared almost completely and virus circulation was significantly reduced, as documented by the serological surveillance system, after a single vaccination cycle. This led to a significant decrease in the areas subject to movement restrictions. Data generated by both field and controlled experiments contributed to modify the EU approach to BT and to some of the conclusions of the Third OIE International Symposium on Bluetongue that will probably lead to a modification of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) standard.},

In four years the disease spread through Southern and Central Italy, involving 14 Italian regions out of 20. To control the disease, the Ministry of Health established a surveillance system that included clinical, entomological and serological surveillance elements. The National Reference Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology - Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise 'G.

abstract={We have measured the content of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (together defined as "dioxins") in 269 samples of food of animal origin collected through the regional veterinary services, covering the national territory. Quantification of the dioxins was accomplished by isotope dilution method, and toxic equivalents (TEQ) were calculated. The average daily food intake was obtained from two main sources: national data collected by the National Institute of Nutrition, and data from an ongoing cohort study on diet and cancer including 40, 000 Italian subjects. The mean value of dioxins measured in food of animal origin was 0.144 ± 0.266 pg-TEQ/g (range: 0.003-1.655 pg-TEQ/g). Fish was the item with the highest content. The estimated intake of dioxins with main food items of animal origin is presented. The major contribution to dioxins intake with food comes from cow milk and fish consumption. These results are in agreement with what observed in studies conducted in other countries, such as Germany, Finland, Japan, Spain, and are below the limits set by the European legislation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In this work, gold based quartz crystals were modified with synthetic oligopeptides, designed as biomimetic traps using computational approach, to obtain piezoelectric sensors selective to the dioxins. After the optimisation of the methodology using standard solutions, as a practical analytical application, three food matrices (poultry, eggs and milk) spiked at three different dioxin levels were analysed. The cross-reactivity of the system was also quantified spiking the samples with commercial polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and a mixture of PCBs and dioxins. The response of the sensors was not influenced by any of matrices tested either before or after the cleanup steps. The negligible matrix-effect could lead to a simplification of the extraction procedure. Basing on this screening method a rapid assignment of the samples to different degrees of toxicity could be possible reducing the use of high-resolution gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS). © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The authors studied the persistence of infection in 46 ewes experimentally infected with Brucella melitensis biovar 3 and monitored through three subsequent reproductive cycles. The entire experimental period lasted for 151 weeks. Infection of ewes and elimination of Brucella in milk, or its presence in vaginal discharges, persisted throughout the duration of the trial, as demonstrated by recurrent elimination of Brucella in milk and vaginal discharges. Brucella melitensis was recovered from the tissues of one ewe killed at the end of the trial. The strain was recovered from vaginal swabs and milk following parturition in the third reproductive cycle from an ewe that had aborted in the first cycle but was not pregnant in the second cycle. From a public health point of view, the periodical recovery of Brucella from the milk during the entire trial period illustrated that brucellosis in sheep remains a continuous occupational risk and a significant public health problem for consumers of fresh milk and milk products. That risk may persist for at least 3 years following the initial infection of the flock. Lamb antibody titres became negative in all lambs within 5 months after birth. This suggested that serological tests on lambs may have no practical diagnostic significance if performed during the first 5 months of life. Nevertheless, the birth of three infected lambs suggested that the phenomenon of latent carrier state may represent another way for B. melitensis to persist in a flock. © 2005 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={The paucity of dogs dedicated to animal-assisted therapy (AAT) for disabled people creates long waiting lists worldwide and compromises the health of the few certified animals by demanding too much work from them at times, thus jeopardizing their future as service dogs. In an attempt to obviate this situation, a mathematical model has been conceived to select animals endowed with a set of specific inborn skills from a population of sheltered dogs. The model is able to select dogs capable of creating a special bond with humans and able to work anywhere and with any human partner or team; it represents a rapid, inexpensive and coherent method and has been validated after 1 year of observation. The algorithm consists of three steps. Step A is a test assessing the aggressiveness and temperament of animals and selection occurs based on a binary criterion (yes or no). Step B is a test comprising three items and selects animals able to interact with humans; dogs have to fulfil two conditions to pass on to Step C. Step C is a test evaluating the animal's ability to respond appropriately to easy commands (trainability) given by different partners; dogs have to fulfil two interrelated conditions judged more flexibly than in test B. The aims of the Ethotest are: (a) to prevent aggressive animals from entering animal-assisted activity and/or Therapy programmes; (b) to select dogs with the right aptitude and especially to restrict selection to dogs that offer consistent responses; (c) to include both male and female purebreds or mix breeds older than 1 year of age; (d) to identify animals able to work with different partners. Moreover, the aim of this contribution is to share with the scientific community an easy method to select shelter dogs as safe companion animals. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The complete nucleotide sequences of the VP2 segments of bluetongue virus (BTV) isolates recovered from Italy, Greece and Israel, from 1998 to 2003, were determined. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences, those from related viruses and the South African vaccine strains, were used to determine the probable geographic origin of BTV incursions into Italy. Results indicated that viruses from each of the four serotypes isolated in Italy (2, 4, 9 and 16) possibly had a different origin. Analysis of the bluetongue virus serotype 2 (BTV-2) isolates gave evidence that this serotype probably moved from Tunisia. BTV-4 results showed probable incursion from the southwest and not from Greece or Israel. BTV-9 isolates clearly have an eastern origin (most probably Greece), whereas BTV-16 isolates are indistinguishable from the BTV-16 live attenuated vaccine strain. The phylogenetic findings were supported by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis of the complete amplified genome of each isolate except for BTV-16 Italian field isolate, which showed a slightly different PAGE profile. A combination of the complete VP2 sequencing and PAGE analysis of complete genomes, allowed not only phylogenetic analysis, but also vaccine detection and assessment of reassortment events. © 2005 The Authors.},

A poacher, after having snared a wild boar (Sus scrofa) sow, knifed it to death. The animal was retrieved by conservation officers at the scene before the poacher could remove the carcass. Subsequently, the suspect denied the charges. During a search of his home, a bloodstained knife was confiscated. A method to identify the species from the DNA extracted from the stains revealed the blood to be that of the non-domestic form of Sus scrofa. Further DNA typing for individual identity using species-specific single tandem repeats or microsatellites (STRs) showed that the DNA on the knife matched that of the poached boar. Based upon the forensic evidence obtained, the suspect was convicted of poaching and of cruelty to animals. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Biting midges of the genus Culicoides include vector species for orbiviral diseases, such as bluetongue and African horse sickness. Although the Afro-Asiatic species C. imicola is the major vector of bluetongue in the Mediterranean basin, recent outbreaks in regions where C. imicola is absent has incriminated other Culicoides, including those belonging to the Obsoletus Complex of the subgenus Avaritia Fox, 1955. The classical taxonomy of this species complex is unclear and this stimulated the molecular analysis of twenty Culicoides populations sampled from eighteen localities across Italy. Ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 sequences were used to characterize the intra- and interspecific variation between Italian members of the Obsoletus Complex and related species, by means of an analysis of molecular variance and phylogenetic analyses. Although morphological differentiation is often extremely difficult, the molecular analysis clearly demonstrated a high degree of divergence between most species. The study showed that at least seven species of the subgenus Avaritia occur in Italy; these are C. obsoletus, C. scoticus, C. montanus, C. dewulfi, C. imicola and two species that could not be identified with certainty, but one of which is similar to C. chiopterus. Finally, a simple polymerase chain reaction assay was developed that rapidly discriminates between four members of the Obsoletus Complex in Italy, a prerequisite for vector identification. © 2005 The Royal Entomological Society.},

abstract={The European Union (EU) strategy with respect to sheep and goat brucellosis aims to eradicate the infection and achieve officially brucellosis-free (OBF) status in all EU holdings and territories. Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 states that to maintain OBF status of ovine or caprine holdings located outside an OBF territory, only a representative number of animals need to be tested annually. However, depending on the number of animals in a holding, this testing method risks non-detection of the infection, thereby reducing the efficacy of the brucellosis control plan. The recommended sampling procedure has a low sensitivity for detecting infection in medium-sized flocks; furthermore, the risk of not detecting re-infection in OBF flocks, particularly in territories that have not yet gained OBF status, is also not acceptable. Moreover, in large-sized flocks, the Directive sampling procedure entails taking an excessive number of samples, which can be very expensive. The authors evaluated, by using statistical analyses and a simulation model based on field data, the possible consequences of the current EU strategy. It is suggested that the sampling criteria for the maintenance of OBF status in the EU should be modified and that a statistically based sampling method should be applied instead of the fixed percentage method that is currently in use. © 2005 Blackwell Verlag.},

In the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) European Region the well-established body of national and European Union laws in existence is growing continuously. The growth is due to various factors, such as new technology in animal farming and experimentation, exploitation of wildlife, new understanding of animal needs, and increasing public awareness and concern. The latter, in particular, determines the need for new animal welfare legislation to regulate and discipline the 'use' of animals for different purposes, such as food production, companionship, work and leisure. This paper intends to provide an overview of the more relevant activities carried out by the Council of Europe and the European Union in the field of animal welfare.

abstract={Consequent upon the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, the European Union (EU) Commission enacted various decisions, which demanded that all bovine animals over 30 months of age should be examined by one of the approved rapid tests when slaughtered for human consumption. All cattle over 24 months of age subject to 'special emergency slaughtering' or died on the farm or in transit or suspect of BSE infection should also be examined by one of the approved rapid tests. According to a specific commission decision, Sweden and Finland were to test only a sample of bovine animals over 30 months of age subject to normal slaughter. Testing commenced on 1 January 2001. The authors evaluate the results of more than 5 million tests performed in the second semester 2001 from across the EU. The prevalence of BSE in the risk categories considered (emergency slaughter, fallen stock and healthy slaughtered), and the probability distribution of true-positive, false-positive and false-negative results are estimated by second-order Bayesian analysis. The results of the validation of tests performed in the EU are also considered by estimation of the probability distribution of their sensitivity and specificity. The prevalence of infection estimated in the cattle population of each EU country is compared against the criteria given in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code and is also used to evaluate the consistency of the results of EU Geographical BSE Risk with the actual infection levels in the countries. Finally, the capability of the two current approaches to BSE surveillance (i.e. the testing of all slaughtered and dead cattle as applied in the EU and a surveillance system targeted at animals in risk categories only) to detect the infection in a given population are discussed. © 2005 Blackwell Verlag.},

abstract={Between July and September 2002 there were outbreaks of bluetongue on three sheep holdings in the communities of San Gregorio Magno (Salerno, Campania), Laviano (Salerno, Campania) and Carpino (Foggia, Puglia), and the involvement of bluetongue virus (BTV) was confirmed serologically and virologically. The mortality rate was at least 11 per cent and involved BTV serotype 2 (BTV-2) and serotype 9 (BTV-9). These holdings were also surveyed for the Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) vectors; approximately 10,000 midges belonging to 15 species were captured, but they did not include a single specimen of the classical Afro-Asiatic bluetongue vector, Culicoides imicola. Species belonging to the Obsoletus complex dominated the light-trap collections, and Culicoides obsoletus Meigen, Culicoides scoticus Downes and Kettle and Culicoides dewulfi Goetghebuer constituted 90 per cent of all the Culicoides species captured. Fifty-six pools of the Obsoletus complex (excluding C dewulfi), each containing 100 individual midges and containing only parous and gravid females, were assayed for virus. BTV-2 was isolated from three pools from San Gregorio Magno and Carpino, and BTV-9 was isolated from one pool from Laviano. These results indicate that a species other than C imicola is involved in the current re-emergence of bluetongue in the Mediterranean Basin, but whether it is C obsoletus sensu stricto or C scoticus, or both, is uncertain.},

abstract={Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) is the causative agent of ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA). In this study, we followed over a 31-month period the natural transmission of JSRV in adult sheep and in their offspring. We established groups derived from flocks with either a high or low incidence of OPA and monitored virus transmission, clinical disease and macroscopic/ microscopic lung lesions at necropsy. Results obtained show that (i) JSRV infection can occur perinatally or in the first few months of life in lambs and in adult sheep; (ii) only a minority of JSRV-infected animals develop clinical disease during their commercial lifespan; and (iii) JSRV is more readily detectable in peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs than in the lungs. These data support a model of opportunistic JSRV infection and tumorigenic conversion of type II pneumocytes/Clara cells in the lungs, while lymphoreticular cells serve as the principal virus reservoir. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Bivalves filter large volumes of water and can concentrate organisms which are pathogenic for humans and animals. Our aim was to evaluate the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in clams from the Adriatic coast (Abruzzo region) and genetically characterize the oocysts isolated from the clams. From March to July 2003, 960 specimens of clams (Chamelea gallina) present in nature were collected at 500 m from the Tordino, Tronto, Vibrata and Vomano river mouths on the Adriatic sea. The haemolymph and tissues were extracted from the specimens (240 per river mouth) after the specimens had been identified, measured and weighed (live weight). Immunofluorescence tests (IFA) were performed on pools (n = 32) of samples and oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. were detected in 23 pools of C. gallina. To identify the Cryptosporidium species, all the pools IFA-positive were tested by a PCR assay specific for the Cryptosporidium outer wall protein (COWP) gene. Positive amplicons then were sequenced and analysed. Two pools of clams were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum Genotype 2 (the "bovine" i.e. zoonotic genotype). This is the first time that C. parvum was found in clams from the Adriatic sea in Italy and the case might be of public health importance. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Sandwich ELISA that included a culture enrichment stage, and 2 different PCR diagnostic systems were used to detect MmmSC in lung and mediastinal lymph node tissues from these animals. The comparison of typical CBPP pathology with the results of detection revealed that no single one of these methods provided a perfect match to the pathological data. Best performing tests were the PCR with laser induced fluorescence and PCR with pleuroTRAP kit (Chemicon, Australia), which are diagnostic systems based on amplification of genomic MmmSC DNA followed by sensitive detection of the amplified products. These were followed by the broth-enriched sandwich ELISA, which uses a monoclonal antibody specific to the M. mycoides cluster, to capture the antigen. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Native red deer of Mesola Wood, northern Italy, were compared with the Sardinian subspecies and with some populations from the Italian Alps and Austria using the analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RELP) of mitochondrial (mt) DNA segments. The results highlight the existence of four main genetic lineages, and provide evidence for a structuring of populations according to their geographic occurrence. Two mitochondrial lineages, although highly distantly related, are shared between the populations from the centre-eastern Alps of Italy and Austria, while the other two lineages characterize the Sardinian and Mesola red deer, respectively. The exclusive haplotype found in the Mesola population appears as being an offshot of one of the two main Alpine lineages, suggesting a presumed origin of these deer from a panmictic population which dwelt in mid-southern Europe, prior to the fragmentation of populations caused by human activities and manipulations. Considering their distinctiveness in morphologic and genetic traits, as well as their historical background and biogeographical value, these native deer should be regarded as a national conservation priority. The Sardinian red deer is highly divergent from both Mesola and Alpine populations. However, the controversial question of the phylogeographic origin of this subspecies remains unresolved. The utility of RELP analyses of mtDNA segments as a tool to discriminate among red deer populations as well as to develop effective strategies for their conservation and management. © 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract={A fast and ultrasensitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for aflatoxin M1 in milk samples has been developed and validated. The method is an indirect competitive type format involving the immobilization of an aflatoxin M1-bovine serum albumin conjugate on 384 well black polystyrene microtiter plates and the use of a secondary antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase detected with a luminol-based substrate. Aflatoxin M1 standard solutions were prepared in milk-based buffer, and milk samples were analyzed without any cleanup procedure. The limit of quantification was 1 ppt, the coefficient of variation was below 9% for both intra- and interassay precision, and the recovery ranged from 96 to 122%. The method is specific, and other aflatoxins do not significantly cross-react with the antibody. Twenty-four milk samples were analyzed, and a good correlation was observed (y = 0.98x + 1.71, r2 = 0.98, n = 24) when the data were compared with a reference high-performance liquid chromatography method with a fluorescent detector. The developed method is suitable for an accurate, sensitive, and high-throughput screening of aflatoxin M1 in milk samples with a reduction of costs and increased detectability, as compared with previously developed immunoassays. © 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={In the European Union the serological diagnosis of brucellosis caused by Brucella melitensis is performed using the heterologous antigen of B. abortus S99. The possible higher sensitivity or ability of an early detection of antibodies by a homologous antigen may prove very useful in the final phases of an eradication programme. Results obtained in sheep experimentally infected by B. melitensis biovar 3 were compared using B. abortus S99, B. melitensis M1, M2 and M3 antigens in the Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT), the complement fixation test (CFT) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Forty-six sheep from an officially brucellosis-free flock were experimentally infected intraconjunctivally with B. melitensis biovar 3. Prior to infection, all animals were tested first against Brucella antibodies, weekly for 2 months post-infection (PI) and then monthly for a further 71/2 months. All sera were tested against the antigens listed above using RBPT, CFT and ELISA. Using a Bayesian approach, test sensitivities were estimated and compared. Their ability for the early detection of antibodies was evaluated through a regression model based on a logit response model, using the number of days PI as the independent variable and the logit of the fraction of positive animals as the dependent variable. No significant differences were detected among the various antigens used, either in terms of sensitivity or in terms of antibody kinetics; however, the CFT was significantly less sensitive than the RBPT and ELISA and it also showed a lower rate of increase of percentage positive animals (β-coefficient of regression analysis). © 2005 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.},

abstract={Diagnostic differentiation between the ruminant pathogens Mycoplasma agalactiae and Mycoplasma bovis is known to be problematic when only conventional serological and biochemical tests are used. The main reason for this is that both agents share a considerable number of related proteins and common epitopes. DNA-based detection methods offer advantages in terms of specificity and sensitivity. However, there is an urgent need to compare currently used PCR assays because they target different genomic regions and, therefore, may perform differently. In the present work, five laboratories, which use PCR routinely, evaluated the specificity of four different PCR systems for M. agalactiae and three systems for M. bovis on a total of 41 strains of the two Mycoplasma species including six previously unidentified strains. As the vast majority of PCR examinations (97.1% of all tests) correctly identified the strains the specificity of all seven detection systems appears to be high. In four cases, incorrect identification by conventional diagnostic methods was rectified by PCR. Isolates from non-typical hosts, i.e. three M. bovis strains from small ruminants and two M. agalactiae strains from cattle, were characterised by sequencing the 16S and part of the 23S ribosomal RNA genes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={An effective liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) detection and identification is presented for the determination of chloramphenicol (CAP) in honey. After a preliminary dissolution in water, samples were extracted with a mixture of dichloromethane/acetone and evaporated to dryness; the following clean up was carried out on an octadecyl (C 18) SPE cartridge. CAP was determined by LC-MS/MS, using electrospray ionization in the negative ion mode (ESI-). The column was a LUNA Phenomenex with a mixture of methanol-aqueous ammonium acetate (60:40, v/v) as a mobile phase. Honey samples were fortified at CAP levels 0.30-0.45-0.60 μg kg-1 with 5D-CAP as internal standard. At these levels, trueness ranged between 98.7 and 102.0% and within-laboratory reproducibility was lower than 6.2%, expressed as relative standard deviation. The limit of decision (CCα) was 0.07 μg kg-1 and detection capability (CCβ) was 0.10 μg kg-1. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A gas chromatographic (GC) method with mass spectrometry detection (MS) for the determination of eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in olive pomace oil has been developed. The oil was diluted with n-pentane and extracted by liquid-liquid partition with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). After water addition and back-extraction with cyclohexane, a thin-layer chromatography on silica gel was performed as a further purification step. The PAHs spot was scraped off from the plate and the final extract was concentrated and analysed by GC-MS in full scan mode. The eight PAHs under investigation were determined in the presence of the corresponding labelled compounds added as internal standards to the sample at the beginning of the analytical process. The identified PAHs were then quantified by the isotope dilution methodology assuring the compensation of the concentration of each analyte for any variation in the sample preparation. The method precision was satisfactory with relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) values in the range 3.6-12.7% for all PAHs. The average recovery rates ranged from 69.0 to 97.5%. Accuracy was also calculated for benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene by analysing a certified reference material (CRM 458, coconut oil) with adequate results. All response curves exhibited a linear fit from 0.1 to 10 μg ml -1 and the determination coefficients R 2 were better than 0.9942. The limits of detection (0.1-0.4 μg kg -1) were acceptable when compared with the maximum permitted limit of 2 μg kg -1 for each of the eight considered PAHs and 5 μg kg -1 for the sum of the eight PAHs established by the Italian legislation. Measurement uncertainty was finally calculated identifying and quantifying the uncertainty components of the analytical process. The relative expanded uncertainties (U c), expressed as percent values were in the range 8.5-11.4% thus appropriate for residues quantification in the range of concentrations considered in the present study. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that brucellosis in Italy is a food-borne, rather than an occupational disease. This hypothesis was tested using data for both human and animal populations from the period 1997-2002. The correlation between the distribution of the disease in the human, sheep and goat populations was analysed, as were the risk factors for the disease, with respect to gender, age, occupation and residence of the individuals involved. Notifications of human brucellosis, which are mandatory in Italy, reach a peak between April and June. However, considering the standard incubation period of 2-4 weeks, and the fact that lamb slaughter is traditionally at a peak during the Easter period, it might be expected that occupational exposure would result in a peak of human cases between March and May. The observed peak between April and June could be related to the production and consumption of fresh cheese, starting just after lamb slaughter. The age of patients showed a fairly uniform distribution, and analysis of incidence rates of human brucellosis between 1997 and 2002 showed that the incidence rates were consistent with an occupational exposure risk of about 25%. © 2005 Copyright by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.},

abstract={The affiliation assessment and management of risks is a traditional part of veterinary medicine. In the past, veterinary services involved in this type of activity usually assessed risks qualitatively. However, since the 1990s, quantitative methods have become increasingly important. The establishment of the World Trade Organization in 1994, and the promulgation of its Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the "SPS Agreement") led to an increased application of import risk analysis and to significant improvements in the methodology of risk analysis as applied to international trade policy for animals and animal products. However, there was very little development of risk analysis in veterinary fields other than international trade and management of health risks to consumers of animal products and little has been published on its use in the choice and definition of control or prophylaxis strategies for animal diseases. This article describes a quantitative risk assessment, which was undertaken in Italy to help choose an appropriate national response strategy following an incursion of bluetongue, an infectious disease of sheep and goats. The results obtained in this study support the use of risk analysis as a tool to assist in choosing an appropriate animal disease management strategy. The use of risk analysis in the evaluation of disease management strategies also offers advantages in international trade. It makes easier the comparison of different strategies applied in the various countries, and thus facilitates the assessment of equivalence of the guarantees provided by different strategies.},

abstract={A total of 3879 samples of foodstuffs were examined for the presence of Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 (VTEC O157). The survey was conducted by 9 of the 10 Italian Veterinary Public Health Laboratories. Samples were collected between May 2000 and September 2001 in 14 regions and comprised 931 minced beef specimens and 2948 dairy products (DP) with less than 60 days of ripening. The DP included 657 pasteurised and 811 unpasteurised bovine DP, 477 pasteurised and 502 unpasteurised ovine DP, and 501 water-buffalo's milk mozzarella cheese. Samples were collected at retail level, from plants processing minced beef and dairy plants and from farms directly manufacturing cheeses. All the samples were tested using a sensitive procedure based on ISO/DIS 16654:1999 (later ISO 16654:2001), which includes an immunomagnetic separation step. A preliminary inter-laboratory trial was organised with artificially contaminated samples to assess the ability of all the participating laboratories to isolate E. coli O157 by the established procedure. VTEC O157 was isolated from four (0.43%) of the minced beef samples, collected in four different regions and during different months, but was not detected in any of the dairy products. E. coli O157 VT-eae+ was isolated from one raw cow's milk cheese. This survey provided national data on the presence of VTEC O157 in foodstuffs, demonstrating a low prevalence of the organism. The survey also encouraged updating of knowledge and procedures on VTEC O157 in laboratories with official responsibility for microbiological testing of foods of animal origin. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={A model Intel-laboratory testing scheme was developed by the Italian National Reference Laboratory for Brucellosis. This scheme was planned for both qualitative (Rose Bengal Plate Test; RBPT) and quantitative (Complement Fixation Test; CFT) serological tests and involved a total of 42 laboratories. In the preparation of this scheme, reference was made to general protocols and guidelines and to methods reported in the literature, which were applicable to analytical chemistry laboratories. Six field sera from naturally infected animals, one positive serum at a titer below the European Union (EU) positivity threshold, and 5 sera positive at titers between 20 and 851 International Units of Complement Fixation Test (IUCFT)/mL plus one negative serum were used to produce a panel of test sera. To evaluate laboratory performances in the quantitative test for each tested sample examined, z-scores based on robust summary statistics (the median and normalized interquartile range) were used. To evaluate overall laboratory performance, 2 types of combined z-scores were used: Rescaled Sum of Scores and Sum of Squared Scores. In the case of the qualitative test (RBPT), results were analyzed by a Bayesian approach. A Beta distribution, based on the result of each laboratory, was calculated and used to estimate the probability of each laboratory giving a correct result and its uncertainty.},

abstract={The detection of nucleotide sequences specific for genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in raw and processed food is based on different technological strategies, such as the extraction of DNA and the amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which allow to obtain qualitative and quantitative information. We developed a multiplex PCR-based DNA assay for simultaneously detecting multiple target sequences in genetically modified (GM) soybean (Roundup Ready™). Internal control target (lectin gene) was included both to assess the efficiency of all reactions and eliminating any false negatives. The post-PCR analysis was carried out by 2.5% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining and densitometric analysis. The multiplex PCR method, showing high sensitivity and specificity, was tested on DNA extracted from certified reference samples containing GM soybean, and from food samples (feeds, food supplements, etc.). Comparison of this method with a quantitative evaluation, carried out by real-time PCR, suggests a possible utilization of the multiplex approach for semi-quantitative determinations. The method reported in this work can considerably reduce the time and the costs of the GM soybean detection, especially in the screening of a large number of food samples.},

abstract={It is well known that the immune response in sheep against Brucella melitensis is subject to individual variation, depending on diverse factors. It bears asking whether these factors (e.g. clinical disease, active infection, state of previous immunity), when affecting a group, can cause variation in the performance of different diagnostic tests. To clarify some of the circumstances in which this immune response can vary, we examine the immune-response profile of sheep protected against the clinical disease by prior vaccination with strain Rev. 1 in comparison with the profile of unprotected females showing the classical brucellosis symptoms. An experimental infection was provoked at midpregnancy under controlled conditions of both non-vaccinated (n=7) and previously Rev.1-vaccinated ewes (n=5). Their immune response was monitored from 7 to 9 weeks before abortion or normal birth to 30 weeks afterwards. Antibody response was assessed by classical tests (Rose Bengal test, complement fixation test (CFT)) in comparison with other diagnostic tests (indirect ELISA (iELISA), competitive ELISA (cELISA), fluorescence polarization assay (FPA), immunocapture test (ICT)). In addition, the cell-mediated immune response was indirectly evaluated by the in vitro antigen-specific release of gamma-interferon. The antibody levels and antigen-specific gamma-IFN profile of the non-vaccinated ewes having the disease and excreting the pathogen was notably high and differed significantly (P<0.05 or P<0.01) from those of vaccinated ewes that neither contracted brucellosis nor excreted the pathogen. In general, all the tests detect the infection in the non-vaccinated ewes with substantial effectiveness. It can be concluded that the high levels of circulating antibodies and of antigen-specific gamma-IFN are related to active Brucella infection. Similarly, the state of protection against the disease, but not necessarily against infection, due to a previous immunization with the Rev. 1 vaccination, appears to be responsible for a low level of detectable immune response. Nevertheless, the design of the study limits conclusions to pregnant ewes and cannot be extrapolated to non-pregnant ewes or rams. Likewise, the study provides no information on animals which are carriers of B. melitensis. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Individual identification was assessed for 30 brown bears (Ursus arctos) from the endangered Apennine population in central Italy, mostly through non-invasive sampling. Shed hairs were used as a source of DNA to obtain single genotype profiling at 12 microsatellite loci. Average expected heterozygosity (0.438) and mean number of alleles per locus (2.2) showed that the level of genetic diversity was one of the lowest recorded for brown bear populations across their European and North American ranges. A large portion of the original genetic variation may have been lost through random genetic drift during the recent period of isolation. The level of genetic variability proved sufficient to identify the bears individually by using nine microsatellite loci. The probability that two animals shared by chance the same multilocus genotype was estimated to be 1 in 100. Despite the recent history of small population size, the average relatedness indicated that the majority of individuals are not first-order relatives. Simulated paternity tests showed that a 12-loci genotype may be necessary to assign paternity with an 80-95% confidence level. Lack of genetic diversity, as well as the maintenance of an adequately effective number, may seriously jeopardise the long-term survival of this population. Furthermore, high mortality rates, poaching and encroachment by human activities represent immediate, urgent concerns. A population increase through enforced protection and habitat restoration is recommended. Presently, restocking with bears from other source populations should be discouraged to avoid genetic extinction. Non-invasive sampling provided reliable population and individual genetic data. Microsatellite genotyping proved a valuable genetic tagging method and a feasible alternative to conventional field counts for the brown bear in central Italy. © 2004 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={The antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates of Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and Infantis isolated from humans, foodstuffs and farm animals in Italy between 1999 and 2001 was examined. All the isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin, but high rates of resistance were observed for several other drugs, especially for S. Typhimurium. The rates of resistance and multiresistance were generally higher among animal and food isolates than in human strains; conversely, no significant difference was observed between animal and food isolates. Among S. Typhimurium, multiresistance was more common in bovine, poultry and rabbit strains than in swine isolates, and was rare in strains from pigeon. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was mainly found in isolates of swine and human origin. This study confirms the role of livestock as a reservoir of drug-resistant Salmonella spp. and underlines the need for integrated surveillance systems of antibiotic resistance that consider isolates not only from human disease but also from the animal reservoirs and the food vehicles. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={A study was carried out on four adult cattle to assess the pathogenicity of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC strain T1/44, currently used as a vaccine for the control of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in Namibia. Post mortem examination 9 weeks after endobronchial inoculation of the vaccine strain to three of the four animals revealed unilateral pleuropneumonic lesions, pleuritis and well-developed sequesters in two of the three inoculated animals and several small sequesters surrounded by pleuropneumonic lesions in the diaphragmatic and apical lobes in one animal. The fourth animal, which was not directly inoculated but was in close contact with the inoculated animals, revealed only an adhesion area of the lung to the ribcage. Serological examination carried out using the complement fixation test (CFT) detected positive titres in all three intubated animals and the indirect CBPP-LppQ-ELISA was positive for two of the three inoculated animals. The contact animal showed no seroconversion. M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC was isolated from the sequesters of two of the inoculated animals. Isolation of mycoplasmas was not possible from the third inoculated animal due to heavy contamination of the samples by other bacteria, but the presence of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC could be evidenced by PCR from clinical samples. The identity of the T1/44 vaccine strain isolated from the sequesters of two animals was confirmed by T1/44-specific PCR analysis and by IS1296 typing using Southern blot. These results clearly show that inoculation of T1/44 vaccine via the endobronchial route can lead to CBPP. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Fifty-eight multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica strains of 20 serotypes, isolated from animal sources in Italy, were analyzed for tet(A) and strA-strB, conferring tetracycline and streptomycin resistance, respectively. The strA and strB genes were highly prevalent in Salmonella strains of our collection, being detected in 84% of the streptomycin-resistant strains. In many strains, the strA and strB genes were linked to a particular Tn5393-derivative transposon characterized by the presence of the insertion sequence IS1133, previously identified only in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Sixty-eight percent of the tetracycline-resistant strains were tet(A) positive, indicating that this gene is widely diffused in Salmonella strains circulating in animals in Italy. Most of the tet(A) genes were localized within a deleted Tn1721 transposon variant. Two prevalent repN and repIl resistance plasmids were identified in Salmonella isolates of our collection.},

abstract={Following the first incursion of bluetongue virus (BTV) into Italy, the geographical and seasonal distribution of the biting midge Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), the main vector of BTV and African horse sickness virus, was investigated in two regions of central Italy (Lazio and Tuscany). Surveillance of Culicoides was carried out between July 2001 and December 2002 using light traps: 1917 collections were made in 381 trap sites, well distributed across both regions. During the survey, bluetongue outbreaks were recorded in both regions. Culicoides imicola was found in 89 (23%) trap sites, distributed fairly continuously along the whole western coastline, between 41.2697° N and 44.05724° N. It was found only occasionally inland and usually in low abundance, with catches of more than 1000 specimens per night found in only two sample sites and 74% of catches numbering fewer than 10 specimens. Adults were caught from March to mid December, with peaks ranging from the end of August to mid November. The coastal distribution and the presence of only few sites with year-round records of adult vectors suggests that colonization may have occurred recently, by passive wind-dispersal from external source areas (Sardinia and Corsica). Alternatively, the species may occur in established, previously undetected, autochthonous populations that are limited from extension inland and northern-ward within Lazio and Tuscany by cool winter temperatures.},

abstract={The biting midge Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is the most important Old World vector of African horse sickness (AHS) and bluetongue (BT). Recent increases of BT incidence in the Mediterranean basin are attributed to its increased abundance and distribution. The phylogenetic status and genetic structure of C. imicola in this region are unknown, despite the importance of these aspects for BT epidemiology in the North American BT vector. In this study, analyses of partial mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among 50 C. imicola from Portugal, Rhodes, Israel, and South Africa and four other species of the Imicola Complex from southern Africa, and to estimate levels of matrilineal subdivision in C. imicola between Portugal and Israel. Eleven haplotypes were detected in C. imicola, and these formed one well-supported clade in maximum likelihood and Bayesian trees implying that the C. imicola samples comprise one phylogenetic species. Molecular variance was distributed mainly between Portugal and Israel, with no haplotypes shared between these countries, suggesting that female-mediated gene flow at this scale has been either limited or non-existent. Our results provide phylogenetic evidence that C. imicola in the study areas are potentially competent AHS and BT vectors. The geographical structure of the C. imicola COI haplotypes was concordant with that of BT virus serotypes in recent BT outbreaks in the Mediterranean basin, suggesting that population subdivision in its vector can impose spatial constraints on BT virus transmission.},

Antibodies to MmmSC were detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the vaccinated cattle, although the levels were lower than in a previous study. No antibodies were detected by complement fixation test (CF). After the challenge infection, vaccinated animals developed CF antibody response. They showed significantly reduced mortality compared with controls.

abstract={A 1999 study heightened long-standing concerns over persistent organic pollutant contamination in the Aral Sea area, detecting elevated levels in breast milk and cord blood of women in Karakalpakstan (western Uzbekistan). These findings prompted a collaborative research study aimed at linking such human findings with evidence of food chain contamination in the area. An international team carried out analyses of organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) on samples of 12 foods commonly produced and consumed in Karakalpakstan. Analysis consistently detected long-lasting organochlorine pesticides and their metabolites in all foods of animal origin and in some vegetables such as onions and carrots - two low-cost components of many traditional dishes. Levels of PCBs were relatively low in all samples except fish. Analyses revealed high levels of PCDDs and PCDFs (together often termed "dioxins") in sheep fat, dairy cream, eggs, and edible cottonseed oil, among other foodstuffs. These findings indicate that food traditionally grown, sold, and consumed in Karakalpakstan is a major route of human exposure to several persistent toxic contaminants, including the most toxic of dioxins, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). Intake estimations demonstrate that consumption of even small amounts of locally grown food may expose consumers to dioxin levels that considerably exceed the monthly tolerable dioxin intake levels set by the World Health Organization. Data presented in this study allow a first assessment of the risk associated with the consumption of certain food products in Karakalpakstan and highlight a critical public health situation.},

T. evansi showed 25 polypeptide bands in the Mr range 97-14.8 kDa. The main differences were associated with the presence of secondary bands, relative intensity and the number of bands. Both species gave seven glycoprotein bands; those of 97 and 68 kDa were present in T. equiperdum but absent in T. evansi. Bands of 61 and 28 kDa were present in T. evansi but not in T. equiperdum. Anti-T. equiperdum sera recognized four homologous antigens and cross-reacted with three antigens of T. evansi. Anti-T. evansi sera recognized three homologous antigens and cross-reacted with four T. equiperdum antigens.

abstract={In this work, a disposable electrochemical immunosensor, based on a competitive assay scheme, was applied to detect polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in food. For this purpose, antibodies against PCBs were directly immobilized onto the carbon surface of a disposable screen-printed electrode. A competition between the PCBs present in the sample and a fixed concentration of an enzyme-labeled PCB was realized and evaluated by electrochemical detection. Alkaline phosphatase was used as the enzyme label, coupled with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) as the electrochemical technique. The immunosensor was tested on aroclor mixture detection (1242 and 1248) and then on some typologies of food samples to evaluate the possible application for real sample analysis. Samples analyzed were from different matrixes, such as sheep milk, bovine adipose tissue, and bovine muscle. Results obtained were compared with the accredited results according to ISO 17025 methods for PCB detection (HRGC-LRMS) as a confirmatory analysis. Preliminary results show the possibility to use this device as a screening method in food sample analysis.

abstract={We developed a competitive chemiluminescent (CL) enzyme immunoassay for rapid, sensitive analysis of 19-nortestosterone (19-NT) in bovine urine. Anti-19-NT polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits using a 19-NT-hemisuccinate derivative conjugated with ovalbumin; the derivative was also conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a label. Antibodies were immobilized on 384-well black polystyrene microtitre plates and HRP-labelled 19-NT activity was measured using an efficient chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal® ELISA Femto) after 3 min incubation. Emitted light was recorded using a conventional, photomultiplier-tube-based microtitre plate reader or a sensitive back-illuminated, cooled CCD camera. The developed method fulfils all the requirements of precision (intra- and inter-assay CV &lt; 10%) and accuracy (mean recovery 94-112%), with a detection limit of 0.03 ppb (1.1 x 10-9 mol/L) in a urine matrix. Chemiluminescence enhances detectability of the HRP-labelled tracer (thus lowering the limit of detection with respect to colorimetry) and reduces analysis time. The 384-well microtitre plate cuts the sample/reagent volume (20 μL), a five-fold reduction with respect to the conventional 96-well microtitre plate. The developed method is suitable for high-throughput screening of 19-NT in urine samples, with reduced costs as compared with conventional colorimetric enzyme immunoassays.

abstract={A model was developed to classify the Italian territories in relation to their suitability to harbour populations of Culicoides imicola and, as a consequence, also able to sustain a bluetongue (BT) epidemic. Italy was subdivided into 3507 10 x 10 km cells. In 546 cells at least one collection was made. The cell was considered the unit for all subsequent analyses. Culicoides were collected using Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps. Some traps were operated weekly at chosen sites; the remainder were moved almost daily to new sites. Only the results obtained during the peak August-November period were used, to exclude bias caused by the seasonality of C. imicola. Climate data for the period 1999-2001 were obtained from 80 weather stations. Multiple logistic regression was performed using the presence or absence of C. imicola in a specific cell as the dependent variable. Annual means of daily values for minimum temperature and minimum relative humidity, and the mean altitude above sea level, were the independent variables. The probability of occurrence of C. imicola in each grid cell was used to create a prediction map for Italy. The model was able to correctly classify 77.5% of the 546 grid cells in which at least one collection had been made. Culicoides imicola was found frequently through much of Sardinia, in parts of southern Italy, and further north along the Tyrrhenian coast, but was absent from along most of the Adriatic coast, and the internal mainland, and from most of Sicily. Six detailed maps are provided. Also mapped are areas where the probability of the occurrence of C. imicola is lower than 5%. This identification of possible mountainous C. imicola-free areas in central Italy could facilitate safer animal trade and transhumance, even if BT infections in traded animals or moving stock, were to go undetected. Needless to say this depends upon no cool-adapted species of Culicoides being involved in the transmission of BT disease.},

abstract={In August 2000 bluetongue (BT) disease appeared amongst sheep on the island of Sardinia spreading later to Sicily and to mainland Italy. The majority of areas affected by BT were surveyed for Culicoides imicola, the only proven vector of the disease known to occur in the Mediterranean region. The data from 1456 light-trap collections, made in months with a mean temperature of 12.5°C, were used to test the accuracy of current models predicting the prevalence and abundance of C. imicola across the region. For Italy, the distribution of C. imicola was found to be very irregular and did not fit the modelled predictions. The possible reasons for this are discussed, and suggestions made as to which variables may improve this fit in the development of future risk models. In Italy, past surveys failed to reveal the presence of C. imicola, and so could be construed as evidence of its recent invasion, and thus rampant spread northwards. Although equivocal, historical records indicate that C. imicola was overlooked in the past. Six recommendations are made as to the possible future course of Culicoides research in southern Europe.},

abstract={The aims of the study were to monitor sheep iodine intake in different sheep breeding farms in Abruzzo and to evaluate the effects of iodine supplementation on ovine fertility. The urinary iodine concentrations (UIC) in animals of 8 out of the 11 breeding farms analyzed were borderline (UIC 100-150 μg/l) or very low (UIC≤50 μg/l). Only animals bred in 3 farms showed an adequate iodine intake with a mean UIC≥300 μg/l. Animals with very low iodine intake had lower T4 and T3 (p&lt;0.01) serum levels, compared to those with adequate iodine intake. To investigate the effects of iodine supplementation on ovine fertility, 32 ewes and 20 rams, characterized by low UIC, were randomly divided into 2 groups. One group (16 ewes and 10 rams) received a sc injection of 1 ml of Lipiodol, containing 480 mg of iodine, while the remaining animals were employed as control. This treatment was able to maintain UIC above 300 μg/l for 3 months and to increase T4 and T3 serum levels (p&lt;0.01). After 9 months, the fertility of control and treated animals was assessed by monitoring the rate of successful matings by ultrasonography. The results showed that 100% of treated ewes mated with treated rams were pregnant vs 37% of the control ewes mated with control rams (p=0.007). The iodine content was 4-fold higher in milk from treated ewes (2393±453 μg/l), compared to controls (675±154 μg/l). The results demonstrated that iodine supplementation restores fertility of sheep living in iodine deficient areas and may represent a means to achieve a silent iodine prophylaxis of local populations. © 2003, Editrice Kurtis.},

abstract={Current population structure patterns of roe deer Capreolus capreolus in Spain were assessed through the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Restriction fragment length polymorphism was detected in the D-loop and NADH-dehydrogenase ND1 segments of mitochondrial DNA. Nuclear variation was investigated using 12 microsatellite loci. A total of 126 roe deer were analysed from fourteen sampling sites across the Iberian peninsula, including the Andalusian population from Sierra de Cádiz, which represents the southwestern limit of the distribution of C. capreolus. Results from both mitochondrial and microsatellite variation revealed a considerable level of structuring for roe deer populations throughout the Spanish range. In particular, evidence was provided from mtDNA of a genetic differentiation of roe deer populations in northern Spain from those occurring in southern areas, with a particular distinctiveness of the Andalusian roe deer. Concordant results were obtained from classical clustering analysis based on microsatellite loci. Furthermore, a Bayesian approach to microsatellite data proved more efficiently that northern roe deer are in turn genetically heterogenous, comprising at least three subpopulations. The phylogeographic pattern suggests a history of long-term isolation of the two main groups of roe deer populations, possibly as a consequence of the climatic changes in the Late Pleistocene. The occurrence of two genetic lineages calls for different strategies of conservation and management of this species in the Iberian Peninsula, according to the geographic distribution of populations. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={During the late summer of 1998, veterinary authorities in Tuscany, Italy, received reports of cases of neurologic disease among horses residing in a large wetland area located in the provinces of Florence and Pistoia. West Nile virus was isolated from two of the six horses that died or were euthanized. A retrospective epidemiologic study identified 14 clinical neurologic cases that occurred from August 20 to October 6 (attack rate of 2.8%). A serologic survey conducted over a 700-km2 area in stables with and without apparent clinical cases confirmed a wider spread of the infection, with an overall seroprevalence rate of 38% in the affected area. No significant differences in age-specific prevalence were observed, suggesting that the horses residing in the area had not been exposed previously to West Nile virus and supporting the hypothesis of its introduction in the wetland area during the first half of 1998.},

abstract={A new immunocapture technique has been applied to the diagnosis of ovine brucellosis under experimental conditions. The tests were made on a serum bank derived from both young and adult ewes vaccinated conjunctivally with the Rev 1 strain at a dose of 108 to 109 colony-forming units. Adult ewes were infected experimentally two-and-a-half years after they had been vaccinated and the results were compared with an unvaccinated control group. The condition of each animal in terms of infection with Brucella melitensis was determined by clinical and bacteriological investigations. The development of the immune response was compared by the rose bengal test, the complement fixation test, the Coombs' test and the immunocapture technique for 180 days after the vaccination and for 410 days after the experimental infection, that is, the two following gestations. The results suggest that the new technique is more specific in animals vaccinated conjunctivally, regardless of their age when they were vaccinated. After the experimental infection, significantly (P&lt;0.05) fewer of the vaccinated sheep which were free of clinical signs and were not excreting B melitensis reacted positively to the test.},

abstract={The African trypanosomes T. equiperdum and T. evansi are two pathogenic species in horses with a wide distribution in countries in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa, Asia and part of Europe in the first case and in Africa, Asia and America for the second. These species are the etiological agents of Dourine and Surra or Derrengadera respectively, both are morphologically and antigenically related. It is only possible to differentiate both species by the clinical symptoms and the mechanism of transmission of the infection, which is through coitus for T. equiperdum and by insect bites by hematophagous flies for T. evansi. Secreting hybrids of monoclonal antibodies were prepared against T. equiperdum and T. evansi. They were used a total hydrolyzed antigens for both species and injected in female Balb/c mice intraperitoneally without adjuvant. The hybridomas were cloned and subcloned and seven positive hybridomas were obtained for each trypanosome species. The monoclonal antibodies for both species proved to have relatively low titles (1:80); to be of the IgM class and to have a high cross reactivity with antigens of both species. They were unable to react against separated antigens in western blotting. They reacted appropriately against antigens in ELISA. Our results demonstrate that both species are antigenically very similar, probably due to the structure of the glycosidic moiety of the VSG. These monoclonal antibodies can be useful as tools for the identification and detection of these Trypanosoma species where they do not occur in mixed infections (East Europe and America).},

abstract={Genetic diversity and differentiation were assessed in 12 populations of roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, from Italy, through examination of restriction fragment length polymorphism of two segments in the mitochondrial genome, the D-loop and NADH dehydrogenase 1, and analysis of 13 microsatellite loci. Both methods yielded concordant results and provided evidence for the existence of two genetically distinct lineages of roe deer in the Italian peninsula. One lineage occurs in populations of the Alpine arc, whilst the other is found in those of central-southern Italy, where the existence of subspecies C. c. italicus had been previously proposed. This southern lineage could have a more ancient origin or, alternatively, diverged as a consequence of movements of populations southwards during the Late Pleistocene. The unexpected rediscovery of dense populations of C. c. italicus in southern Tuscany marks them as the most suitable source of roe deer for reintroductions into southern Italy, a very large area where presently the Italian roe deer is nearly extinct. A Bayesian approach to microsatellite data allowed a finer resolution of population structure, indicating that some populations in central Italy, as well as in the western Alps, are admixed, and share ancestry partly in non Italian gene pools, suggesting that human manipulation has greatly affected the natural genetic structure of populations. A palaeontological perspective of the former presence of roe deer in Italy and implications for the management and conservation of C. c. italicus are provided. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={The recognition of a pathogen or a vaccine antigen formulation by cells in the innate immune system leads to production of proinflammatory cytokines, which will determine the ensuing acquired immune response quantitatively and qualitatively. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are the first set of cytokines produced upon such an encounter, which have roles both in protective immunity and immunopathogenesis evident with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). RSV antigens in different physical adjuvant-vaccine formulations were analysed for their capacity to provoke cultured murine peritoneal cells to produce these three proinflammatory cytokines. RSV immunostimulating complex (ISCOM), i.e. both antigen and adjuvant are incorporated in the same particle, induced high levels of IL-1α being of the same magnitude or higher than those of live RSV and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Live virus and LPS induced higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-α than ISCOM and so did non-adjuvanted UV-inactivated RSV but only at high doses. ISCOM-Matrix, i.e. ISCOM without antigens, admixed as a separate entity to inactivated RSV, downregulated or blocked the cytokine response to the inactivated RSV in contrast to ISCOM. Kinetic studies showed that ISCOM induced cytokine production first detected at hours 1, 2, 4 for TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1α respectively, which was earlier than for the other antigen formulations containing corresponding doses of antigen and/or Quillaja adjuvant. Peak values for production of TNF-α and IL-6 were at 8 h and for IL-1α at 72 h following stimulation with ISCOM. The delayed appearance of IL-1α may reflect the cell-bound nature of this cytokine. © 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A fragment of the β-tubulin gene was polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from genomic DNAs of Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, Babesia divergens, Babesia major, Babesia caballi, Babesia equi, Babesia microti, Theileria annulata and Theileria sergenti. Single amplification products were obtained for each of these species, but the size of the amplicons varied from 310 to 460 bp. Sequence analysis revealed that this variation is due to the presence of a single intron, which ranged from 20 to 170 bp. The extensive genetic variability at the β-tubulin locus has been exploited to develop two types of species identification assays. The first assay can be used on samples containing mostly parasite DNA, like those prepared from infected erythrocytes. Following PCR amplification, the species identification is obtained directly from the size of the products (for Babesia species infecting human or horse) or using a simple PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) protocol (for Babesia species infecting cattle). The second assay can be used on samples prepared from whole blood, that contain both parasite and host DNAs. In this case, due to the strong conservation of the β-tubulin gene, co-amplification of a gene fragment from the host DNA was observed. A nested PCR assay was developed for the specific amplification of parasite DNA, using a primer designed to span the exon-intron boundary. Direct identification of Babesia species infecting human and horse is again obtained after the electrophoretic separation of the amplification products, while for Babesia and Theileria species infecting cattle, differentiation is based on a nested PCR-RFLP protocol. These methods may be used for the simultaneous identification of horses and cattle carrying multiple parasites by means of a single PCR or using the PCR-RFLP protocol.

abstract={A study was carried on 1377 water buffalo serum samples from 50 farms in southern Italy to test the presence of Neospora caninum antibodies by indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Rabbit anti-buffalo immunoglobulins conjugated to fluorescein were used in the test. Fluorescence in sera dilutions above 1:200 was considered as indicative of the presence of N. caninum antibodies. The overall prevalence of infection in the animals was 34.6%. The prevalence increased in relation to the age of subjects and most of the herds examined (82%) were found infected. In two farms abortions and neurological signs were reported. No suppurative inflammatory lesions were seen, but few protozoan-like cysts were observed on foetal tissues by histology.

abstract={A fast and sensitive chemiluminescent (CL) enzyme immunoassay for clenbuterol (CLB) analysis in bovine urine has been developed. Clenbuterol (CLB) specific polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbit using a CLB azo derivative conjugated with ovalbumin. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as label and conjugated with the same derivative. In the developed competitive method, antibodies were immobilized on 384-wells black polystyrene microtiter plates; the sample volume was 20 μl and HRP-labeled CLB activity was immediately measured, using different CL substrates, after 10 min incubation time. Emitted light was recorded using a sensitive back- illuminated, cooled CCD camera or a conventional, photomultiplier-based microtiter plate reader. The developed method fulfills all the requirements of precision (CV below 10%) and accuracy (mean recovery from 96 to 110%) with a detection limit of 0.08 ppb in urine matrix. The use of 384-wells microtiter plate allows a 5-fold reduction in reagent quantity and the CL detection improves the detectability of the HRP-labeled tracer, thus reducing analysis time. The developed method is therefore suitable for high-throughput screening of CLB in urine samples, with reduced costs as compared with conventional colorimetric enzyme immunoassays, thanks to the possibility to optimize the system in non-equilibrium immunological conditions and with a very fast chemiluminescence detection of the HRP-label activity.

abstract={During final phases of eradication programmes, strains of Mycobacterium sp. not belonging to the tuberculosis complex increase their relative frequency and are responsible for positive skin test reactions. Moreover, the specificity of any indirect diagnostic test, such as the skin test, is never completely accurate, therefore even when tuberculosis infection is completely eradicated, a number of false positive reactions are to be expected. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the performances of traditional isolation/typing techniques, automatic isolation/typing techniques based on fluorimetric detection of bacterial growth (Bactec), skin tests and the interferon test. Samples examined for the evaluation of test sensitivities originated from 154 infected animals belonging to 32 infected herds. Samples used as negative controls in the evaluation of test specificities originated from 86 animals of nine officially infection-free herds. The automatic isolation/typing technique based on fluorimetric detection of bacterial growth showed higher sensitivity than the traditional isolation typing technique. Moreover, it allowed a safer processing of bacterial cultures, decreasing the risk for laboratory workers. The observed performance of the gamma-interferon test was considered beneficial in that it increased the sensitivity of individual diagnosis within an infected herd, especially in 'problem herds', but its poor specificity did not improve detection of infected herds compared to the skin test.},

abstract={In October 1990, an outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) was reported in Italy after an absence of approximately one century. Since October 1990, ninety-four outbreaks have occurred in Italy, of which forty-seven were concentrated in three areas of northern Italy (Lombardy region). The disease was eradicated in September 1993. The data used for the analysis were obtained from the epidemiological investigations undertaken during the outbreaks of 1990-1993. The unit of interest for the analysis is the farm. Spatial segregation of infected and uninfected farms within the study area was determined through the Pielou index of segregation. Data from herds within the same set of outbreaks were analysed through logistic regression to identify factors which could be used to discriminate between infected and uninfected herds. The study indicated a clear spatial segregation between infected and uninfected herds. The results of the analysis do not indicate the mode of disease spread. However, the study demonstrated that both aerosol and indirect transmission of the infection could have occurred, as previously documented in Africa. The possibility that indirect transmission played a prominent role in the spread of CBPP in the region of Lombardy is a completely new suggestion. Further studies are required to understand the epidemiology of CBPP in regions with intensive farming and a relatively cold climate. In particular, three aspects require consideration; firstly, animal movement among neighbouring herds could produce a pattern of disease similar to the one produced by indirect transmission (this possibility was excluded in the epidemiological outbreak investigations conducted by field veterinarians). Secondly, the methods of spatial analysis used in this study have not been previously used in the field of veterinary epidemiology. Further validation of the efficacy of these methods is thus required. Thirdly, the epidemiology of CBPP under conditions of high animal density and a relatively cool climate, as encountered in Lombardy, requires further investigation.},

abstract={Introduction: A system to support decisions and operations in cases of epidemic emergency has been designed and implemented, in order to improve the decision-making capabilities of Veterinary Services for outbreaks of exotic diseases. Methods: The system implementation consisted of: 1) drafting contingency plans for OIE List A diseases; 2) implementing an automated information network, linking Local Veterinary Unit and the Regional Epidemiological Centre; 3) implementing a Geographical Information System (GIS), to be automatically connected to the animal identification database and to the ANIMO (Animal Movement) system; 4) supplying the personnel of Veterinary Services with the necessary tools, instruments and materials; 5) personnel training. Integration of activities led to the implementation of a telematic support system for the management of epidemic emergencies, providing the Veterinary Services with the information necessary to the management of exotic disease outbreaks. The system has been implemented from a structural point of view as follows: 1. Data warehouse design and implementation, fed by ORACLE DATA MART SUITE operational databases,2. Implementation within the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Mouse Web site, of a controlled access telematic system, where: static pages were implemented in HTML and the dynamic ones in PERL; GI S was used to design and update maps; Downloading of documents and forms was made possible as well as the generation of tables and graphs in real time. Results: In the event of an outbreak it is possible to: map relevant data and information (i.e. Protection and Surveillance Zones); to produce disease trend data both in tabular and graphical form and the indicators for the disease management and control. Contingency plans of OIE list A disease are provided through the Internet for consultation and downloading. All the forms for administrative and epidemiological data collection are provided for and can sent by e-mail to the proper veterinary authority and other stakeholders.Discussion: The system has been tested both by a simulated foot and mouth disease outbreak and a real Swine Vesicular Disease outbreak. The existence of written and standardised procedures, the availability of updated and pertinent information for outbreaks management and the support of a telematic system has allowed the rationalisation the actions to be implemented and to speed up intervention time.},

abstract={Sera and blood from cattle and sheep were examined for the presence of Babesia and Theileria spp by microscopy and serology at the Parasitology Department of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale of Abruzzo and Mouse (IZSAM). Of the 47 bovine herds (323 animals) tested, 15 were found positive for Babesia bigemina and 1 for Babesia bovis. Two outbreaks occurred, one caused by B. bigemina and one by B. bovis. The B. bigemina outbreak occurred in Abruzzo and has been followed for two years. The isolate of B. bigemina was very pathogenic leading to the death of two cows out of 57. The vector responsible of the transmission appeared to be Rhipicephalus bursa. Parasites were observed in the erythrocytes for 30 days whereas sera were positive to indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) for at least one year. The B. bovis outbreak occurred in the province of Mantova (Northern Italy) in a group of 70 beef cattle imported from France. The infection resulted in the death of 5 animals and severe illness in another 6. In contrast with what occurred for Babesia infection, no clinical cases were recorded in cattle when species of Theileria were detected by microscopy. Of the 24 bovine herds (252 animals) tested for Theileria, 21 were found positive for the T. "sergenti"/buffeli/orientalis group. Single and mixed infection of T. "sergenti" and T. buffeli/orientalis were detected in herds of cross-bred cattle from Abruzzo and Marche. The parasites were identified by using a polymerase chain reaction which amplified DNA encoding p32/34. Most of the collected ticks (90%) were adults of R. bursa whereas the others were adults of Hyalomma detritum. During the period the animals have been observed (18 months), no clinical cases have been recorded and no associations have been found between blood abnormalities and animals found infected with Theileria. Prevalences of subclinically infected carriers increased from February till December (95.4%) even if the animals were indoors and no ticks were present. The prevalence then dropped dramatically six months later (76.7%). In calves less than 1 year old, the prevalence of infection significantly (p<0.05) increased with age, however intraerythrocytic stages of Theileria were found in the blood of three newborn calves (<7 days of age). Of the 18 ovine flocks tested for Babesia spp. (150 animals examined), 1 was positive for B. ovis and 2 for B. motasi. B. motasi infection was not associated with symptoms, while an outbreak of babesiosis caused by B. ovis occurred in Abruzzo. The infection resulted in the death of 3 animals (0.75% of the flock), two rams (20% of the total number) and a ewe, and severe illness in another 5 ewes (2% of the flock). Specimens of R. bursa and R. turanicus were collected from the infected animals. Of the 18 flocks (150 animals) examined, 12 were microscopically positive for Theileria spp. No clinical cases were recorded and identification at species level was not possible on the basis of morphological criteria. The prevalence distribution of infected herds and infected animals within herds and flocks have been calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation model, running 10000 iterations. The most likely levels of prevalence of infected herds and infected animals within herds found for the species observed were as follows: 20% for B. bigemina with a prevalence within herd of 27%, 11% for B. bovis (18% within herd), 10% for Babesia ovis (19% within herd), 10% for B. motasi (17.5% within herd), 63% for Theileria in cattle (66% within herd) and 51% for Theileria in sheep (55% within herd).},

abstract={Postmortem observations of 37 cattle from an outbreak of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) in north Italy in 1993 were made at the abattoir, where samples of lung and tracheobronchial lymph node tissues were taken for culture and identification of Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides (MmmSC), immunohistochemistry with the peroxidase anti-peroxidase (PAP) system, and molecular detection by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of specific DNA from MmmSC. Nasal swabs were also taken for testing by PCR. Lung pathology typical of CBPP was observed in 38 per cent of the animals, and MmmSC was isolated from 19 per cent. DNA of MmmSC was detected by PCR in 64 per cent of lung samples and 35 per cent of the nasal swabs. Staining of lung tissue and lymph node tissue by PAP was positive in 27 per cent and 30 per cent of cases, respectively, and was a useful back-up test. These results suggest that PCR amplification from lung tissue may be used as a rapid and accurate confirmatory test for cases with pathology resembling CBPP.},

abstract={Babesia equi and Babesia caballi are tick-borne haemoparasites that may cause babesiosis of Equidae. In southern Europe B. equi is enzootic and infections may occur asymptomatically and more frequently than those due to B. caballi. Complement fixation test (CFT) is the official serological test for the diagnosis of equine babesiosis, but it has low sensitivity during early and latent stages of the disease. With the aim of developing more sensitive and rapid direct diagnostic alternatives, PCR systems that amplified DNA targets of 664 or 659 bp regions of the 16S rRNA genes were designed and demonstrated to specifically detect the genomes of B. equi and B. caballi, respectively. An approximated parasitaemia of 0.000083% was detected by the PCR system for B. equi compared with reported limits of 0.001% for microscopic examination of stained blood smears, and up to 0.00025% for DNA probes. Although the sensitivity of the PCR system for B. caballi could not be estimated, samples with microscopically undetectable parasitaemia as well as those with 0.017% parasitised red blood cells were detected. DNA extracts of blood collected with EDTA as an anticoagulant from 23 horses from Portugal were tested with both PCR systems. Of these samples, 22 were positive for B. equi and 8 were positive for B. caballi with PCR tests and intraerythrocytic parasites were seen in all samples. Antibodies against both parasites were not detected by CFT in several cases, but in these cases the presence of either or both parasites was apparent by PCR tests. The PCR systems may be useful in the diagnosis of equine babesiosis covering a wider range of clinical disease, as useful adjuncts to serological, microscopic, and cultural methods, especially for the import and export testing of horses.

abstract={The authors propose a contribution to the possible revision of Chapters 1.4.1. and 1.4.2. of the International Animal Health Code (Code) of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). In particular, data are presented to illustrate some of the inadequacies of both the rationale and the results of the method for risk assessment reported in the Code. The method suggested by the Code for risk assessment is based on the calculation of the 'probability of the occurrence of at least one outbreak' of a given disease following the importation of a given quantity of either live animals or animal products (unrestricted risk estimate). This is usually undertaken when dealing with rare events. For a country such as Italy, this method may not be particularly useful as the frequency of disease outbreaks is what should be estimated, so as to provide decision makers with appropriate and relevant information. Practical use of risk information generated by the use of the OIE risk assessment method for swine vesicular disease (SVD) would have encouraged the Chief Veterinary Officer of Italy to prohibit all imports of swine from the Netherlands and Belgium for at least two years in the early 1990s, with the consequential heavy economic losses for both Italy and the exporting countries. On the contrary, the number of actual outbreaks of the disease due to direct imports of swine from Member States of the European Union (EU), which occurred in Italy in 1992, 1993 and 1994 was very low (two to five outbreaks due to direct imports of swine from the Netherlands and one to two from Belgium). An example of a method for assessing the risks associated with high volumes of trade in commodities is also described. This method is based on the Monte Carlo simulation and provides the information required to evaluate the costs of the strategies compared. The method can be used to predict the number of outbreaks which are likely to occur following importation and enables a comparison to be made of alternative safeguards. This would lead to the selection of the most cost-effective one. The comparison is conducted using risk curves and allows a quantitative evaluation and comparison to be made of various scenarios, varying from an absence of safeguards to combinations of various safeguards.},

The ostriches developed viraemia which was demonstrable on days 1-4 following infection, with a maximum intensity of 4.0 log10 mouse intracerebral LD50/ml being recorded on day 2 in 1 of the birds. Virus was detectable in visceral organs such as spleen, liver and kidney up to day 5 post-inoculation, 1 day after it could no longer be found in blood. No infective virus was detected in samples of muscle, but viral nucleic acid was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in muscle from a bird sacrificed on day 3 following infection. It was concluded that the occurrence of infection in ostriches at abattoirs could be prevented by keeping the birds free of ticks for 14 days before slaughter.},

abstract={The protein and antigen profiles of 60 isolates, strains and the type strain PG1 of Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC were compared by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. Analysis using contagious bovine pleuropneumonia antisera and hyperimmune rabbit sera against several representative strains revealed some differences in protein profiles and variability in antigens among strains from different geographic regions. The most common antigenic bands had the molecular masses of 110, 95, 80, 69, 62, 60, 48, 44, 39 and 38kDa. There were differences among European strains, where a larger group coming from Italy lacked the p98 antigen, thus, with one exception, distinguishing the Italian strains from Portuguese, French and Spanish strains. African, Australian and PG1 strains showed heterogenic profiles, with quantitative differences and in a few strains some antigenic bands were absent. The group constituting African, Australian and PG1 strains was characterised by the presence of 71.5/70kDa antigens, which were not detected in European strains. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC membrane proteins were characterised by Triton X-114 partitioning and p110, p98, p95, p62/60 and p48 were identified as immunogenic antigens. The simultaneous presence of these five antigens was common to all the sera examined and, therefore, indicates the diagnostic potential of immunoblotting. Most immunodominant antigens are surface-exposed proteins as determined by the trypsin treatment. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strains, isolated from outbreaks during epizootics between 1992 and 1996 in Western European countries, were compared by restriction enzyme cleavage site mapping of the fusion (F) protein gene between nucleotides 334 and 1682 and by sequence analysis between nucleotides 47 and 435. Both methods revealed that NDV strains responsible for these epizootics belong to two distinct genotypes. Strains derived from sporadic cases in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Austria were classified into genotype VI [6], the same group which caused outbreaks in the Middle East and Greece in the late 1960's and in Hungary in the early 1980's. In contrast, viruses that caused epizootics in Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain and Italy could be classified into a novel genotype (provisionally termed VII), hitherto undetected in Europe. It is possible that the genotype VII viruses originated in the Far East because they showed a high genetic similarity (97%) to NDV strains isolated from Indonesia in the late 1980's.},

Subsequent surveillance for CBPP was based on random sampling in bovine herds, serological controls on all animals moved from the herd of origin and controls on slaughtered animals. Official tests employed were the complement fixation test (CFT) and bacteriological isolation and typing. A total of 33,856 serum samples collected from herds in CBPP-free regions were used to define CFT specificity, while samples from 595 animals from infected herds were employed to define the sensitivity. Ninety-nine animals from three infected herds were used to estimate the sensitivity of the isolation technique. Results showed the specificity of CFT (threshold +1:10) to be 98% and sensitivity to be 63.79%. The sensitivity of the test did not change significantly, regardless of whether the lesions were caused by acute or chronic infection. The sensitivity of the isolation technique was 54.1%.},

abstract={A method for distinguishing fresh from thawed frozen samples of porcine and bovine meat is proposed. Crude soluble extracts from fresh (stored at + 4°C for 0-3 days) or deep frozen (at -80°C) meat samples from pork and beef, were assayed by blocking ELISA to estimate m-MDH (mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase) titres. As a rule, a separate aliquot of each test sample was placed at -20°C until frozen and subsequently thawed for the preparation of the extract whose analysis gave the 'self reference' m-MDH titre. For a given meat sample calculation of the tau index, 'τ', was proposed as the ratio between the self reference value and the original m-MDH titre. The 95% tolerance for τ for fresh and thawed meat, suggests that the method is suitable for this kind of analysis. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Screening of 43 protein loci was used to evaluate the level of genetic variability in 42 red deer Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758 from Mesola Wood, the only native population presently occurring in peninsular Italy. The survey revealed polymorphism at four loci. In one of them evidence was provided for a significant deficiency of heterozygotes. Average expected heterozygosity and the proportion of polymorphic loci were He = 0.025 and P = 0.093, respectively. Although these values are low, they are consistent with those reported for other European red deer populations. Repeated bottlenecks and slow recoveries along with prolonged selective removal of stags were indicated as affecting genetic variation as a consequence of random drift. A genetic factor may have influenced female fertility and antler conformation. Comparisons with free-ranging deer from the Alps, and with an enclosed population yielded estimates of absolute (mean Nei's 1972 D = 0.004, SD = 0.002; mean modified Rogers' D = 0.063, SD = 0.013) and relative (Wright's FST = 0.094) genetic distance typical for red deer populations. Given the biological value of Mesola red deer, genetic results are discussed in relation to both population history and conservation. A strategy for urgent management interventions is also proposed.},

A significantly (P < 0.001) higher excystation rate (ER) occurred when sodium bicarbonate was added to the excysting fluid at concentrations between 0.075 and 0.3 M. Sporocysts collected from different dogs had different ER. In contrast, although not uniformly distributed along the intestinal lumen, the sporocysts collected from the different tracts of the intestine showed similar ER. The period of storage did not affect the excystability of the sporocysts; however, it influenced the pattern of growth of the sporozoites in cell culture. Sporozoites excysted from sporocysts stored for approximately 2 years grew slower and produced significantly fewer merozoites compared to those excysted from sporocysts stored for 5-7 months.},

abstract={An ELISA using antigen produced from merozoites of Sarcocystis cruzi was developed to monitor specific IgM and IgG antibody, following challenge of cattle with either merozoites or sporocysts of S. cruzi. This assay was compared with an ELISA using antigen produced from the cystozoite stage of the parasite. Both ELISAs were able to detect significant increases in levels of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies against Sarcocystis in all challenged cows; however, the magnitude of the titres was greater in the ELISA which used the antigen derived from the merozoites. This immunoassay also detected increases in the levels of IgG earlier than did the assay using antigen derived from cystozoites of S. cruzi. Since this rise coincided with the presence of clinical signs, and was persistent for several weeks, the IgG-ELISA using antigen derived from merozoites appears to be suitable for the diagnosis of acute sarcocystiosis in cattle. Furthermore, since significant increases in the levels of circulating IgM and IgG antibodies against Sarcocystis were detected in the cows infected with merozoites of S. cruzi, it is evident that merozoites of S. cruzi cultured in vitro maintain their capability to replicate in the natural intermediate host.},

All strains isolated between 1972 and 1984 belong to group I. From 1984 onwards group II isolates (II and II intermediate) replace group I isolates. The isolation of a group I virus in 1993 from a wild boar supports the hypothesis that ADV's may persist for several years in wild boar populations and that wild boars should therefore be considered reservoirs of Aujeszky's disease virus.},

abstract={The accuracies of two ELISAs, one using antigen from merozoites of S. cruzi grown in vitro and the other using antigen from cystozoites of S. cruzi, for detecting infection of cattle with Sarcocystis, were evaluated by testing the sera of 303 cattle from 36 Western Australian herds. The results were compared with those obtained by digestion of oesophageal samples collected from the same animals. A similar proportion of infected animals were detected by the three methods. The sensitivity of the assays for detecting infected cattle was comparable (98 and 95% for the assay using antigen from merozoites and cystozoites, respectively), however the specificity (97%) of the assay which used antigen derived from merozoites was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that (84%) which used antigen from cystozoites. When herds which had at least five animals sampled were considered, the same infected and non-infected herds were detected by the ELISA employing antigen from merozoites and the digestion methods (sensitivity and specificity of 100%). The sensitivity and specificity of the assay using cystozoite antigen were 100 and 67%, respectively. The kappa values for agreement beyond chance between the two ELISAs were calculated as 78% for the animal-based data and 72.5% for the herd-based data. We conclude that because of the high sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA using antigen derived from merozoites, this assay would be a useful and reliable tool for general sero-epidemiological studies into infection with Sarcocystis. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract={Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to assess genetic variability and differentiation at 40 gene loci in 102 roe deer from five sampling sites in the province of Siena, central Italy. Eight loci proved to be polymorphic in at least one population. Averaged over populations, values of expected heterozygosity (mean He = 0.044, SD = 0.007) and the proportion of polymorphic loci (mean P = 0.135, SD = 0.028) were as high as those found for roe deer of southern and central Europe. In spite of a moderately high level of gene flow between sites (Nm = 4.7), the existence of some degree of genetic structuring in the whole population of Siena could be demonstrated. Demographic events (i.e., restocking, bottlenecks), rather than genetic isolation were explained to be responsible for the differences in allele frequencies found among populations. The allochthonous origin of roe deer living on Mount Amiata could be proved by genetic data. The results are discussed in the light of historical and demographic information on this species in the province. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Predation on domestic livestock caused by species of conservation value such as wolf Canis lupus and bear Ursus arctos is a common complaint in parts of the Abruzzo region (Italy) where extensive grazing is practised. The reliability of current damage evaluation methods was found to be weak in relation to identification between canid attacks (wolf or dog) as an ultimate cause of livestock death. An enquiry into the characteristics of farming units damaged by predation showed how the problem of predation could not be viewed in isolation from the socio-economic context in which it occurred. From a sample of communes concerned over predation, only 4.1% of 563 claimants (controlling 25 farming management units) could be considered as 'chronically' affected by predation (> two attacks per year) and took up over a third of the claims. The majority claimed less than one attack per year but 36.1% of these held sheep, cattle or equids for allegedly non-commercial reasons. There is evidence for the expansion of wolves in Italy: the availability of a variety of wild ungulates has been identified as a strong factor in diverting predator pressure from domestic livestock. This may hold true if the management methods of 'at risk' livestock categories are closely monitored and reappraised where necessary. Moreover, economic incentives such as compensation should be aimed primarily at owners most likely to enter into conflict with wildlife, owing to their economic reliance upon traditional husbandry methods.},

abstract={Western and dot blotting techniques were compared with complement fixation tests (CFT), indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), mycoplasma culture and gross lung pathology to detect Mycoplasma mycoides subspecies mycoides SC, the cause of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), in two groups of Italian cattle. None of the animals showed any clinical signs before slaughter. In group A, seven of the 20 cattle had characteristic lung lesions of acute and chronic CBPP but only six were positive by CFT. Western blotting detected antibody in eight of the animals, of which six had lesions and significant CFT titres (>50 per cent fixation at a serum dilution of 1/10) and two had neither. In group B, seven of the 17 cattle had lesions characteristic of CBPP, and 12 were seropositive by CFT. Western blotting detected antibody in 13 of the animals including one which had a negative CFT titre. The ELISA was less sensitive than either CFT or Western blotting, detecting antibody in five animals in group A and nine animals in group B. The dot blotting test correlated well with Western blotting but gave a small number of ambiguous results. The causative organism was isolated from four of the 20 cattle in group A and six of the 17 cattle in group B.},

abstract={A method, for the immunoaffinity extraction of dexamethasone and betamethasone in bovine urine, followed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry determination, is described. A commercial immunoaffinity gel, containing antibodies raised against dexamethasone, was used to prepare an immunoaffinity cartridge which was inserted in an automatic HPLC system for on-line extraction and purification. By injecting urine samples (spiked with flumethasone as internal standard) directly into the system, it was possible to collect purified fractions, containing the analytes of interest. The fractions were dried and derivatized to yield the tetra-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the three corticosteroids, which were analyzed by selected ion monitoring gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The method allowed a very good purification of samples and reached a detection limit of 0.1 ng/ml for dexamethasone and 0.2 ng/ml for betamethasone. Several samples, coming from a steer treated with dexamethasone and from other bovines coming from breedings in northern Italy, were analyzed with the method described. Dexamethasone levels ranged from 0.12 to 146 ng/ml. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={The possibility of using an ELISA for the diagnosis of ovine brucellosis in milk (M-ELISA) was investigated. The aim of the study was to establish whether the specificity and sensitivity of the M-ELISA would be high enough to detect low levels of Brucella antibodies in ewe milk. The diagnostic performances of the test under study were established by means of reference standards and compared with conventional screening and confirmatory tests under field conditions. The diagnostic specificity of the M-ELISA established on a number of samples from Brucella-free flocks was 100% while relative to RBT and CFT positive reactors the M-ELISA demonstrated sensitivity of 65 and 83% respectively. Its sensitivity relative to culture positive animals was of 92%. The course of Brucella antibodies in milk of positive sheep was evaluated in colostrum and in mature milk for a period of 30 days after delivery and it appeared that concentrations of immunoglobulins in milk tend to sharply decrease soon after parturition while in blood serum these remained constantly high. It was concluded that the M-ELISA for Brucella antibodies in ewe milk can be regarded as a complementary diagnostic tool for individual testing but it would be poorly viable if used as a screening test applied to pooled flock milks.},

abstract={19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) is one of the mostly recurrent anabolic agents on the black market of illicit drugs. Dexamethasone (DEXA) is licensed for therapy in veterinary practice but its misuse, although often suspected, has seldom been demonstrated. The excretion of 19-NT and DEXA is well documented when the compounds are administered independently but poor information is available in literature for instances when both drugs are administered as a mixture. To evaluate a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for anabolic residues in urine, blood and faeces, the effect of the simultaneous administration and the subsequent elimination of the two drugs, two animals were injected (4 times) with 19-NT and another two (4 times) with 19-NT-DEXA. After preparation and a sequential clean-up on C18 and alumina columns, the samples were analysed by means of a specific 19-NT radioimmunoassay kit and an anti-DEXA antibody. Detection limits for both drugs were 0.5 ppb in blood samples and 2.0 ppb in urine and faecal samples. After the final treatment, positive 19-NT results were recorded at 14 and 21 d in urine and faecal samples, respectively. In the same matrices, positive DEXA values were found at 11 and 28 d, respectively. Urinary excretion was the main metabolic path both for 19-NT and DEXA; only 30% of the residues were excreted via the faeces. The simultaneous injection of DEXA and 19-NT increased the urinary excretion of 19-NT; however, the excretion of 19-NT via faecal matter was similar for both groups.},

The laws of the region provide for compensation payments to owners for losses caused by predators. In the present paper, 4,993 validated claims made between 1980 and 1988 are examined. Losses ascribed to wolf, bear and wild boar attacks were 92.1%, 7.8% and 0.1%, respectively, of the total losses caused by predators during this period. The victims of wolf attacks were mostly sheep and goats (45.0%) and equids (38.5%), followed by cattle (16.4%) and rabbits, fowl and dogs (0.2%). Bears also principally attacked sheep and goats (67.6%), other targets being cattle (18.5%), equids (9.5%) and bee-hives (4.4%). A significant difference was observed between the number of attacks by wolves and bears; although both populations are of similar size. Other statistically significant differences have been observed between the periods in which the attacks take place on the different livestock and the predator species which reportedly caused the damage. Among cattle and equids, victims are mostly new-born or young animals, while among sheep and goats only adult animals are attacked.},

The virus was isolated from uninfected chicken embryo liver and fibroblast cultures prepared from commercial embryonated fowls' eggs. A serological and virological investigation carried out on the breeders which had laid those eggs showed high titres against NDV, and virus isolation from cloacal swabs. The virus was also isolated from the progeny of the same breeders which showed no clinical signs of ND, following episodes of mortality. Vertical transmission of the virus is discussed. © 1993 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Sera from five traditionally managed herds grazing in the Kafue flats were tested for antibodies to bovine viral diarrhoea-mucosal disease (BVD-MD), parainfluenza 3 (PI3), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis-infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR-IPV), bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV3) and Bluetongue (BT). The sero-prevalences of the first four diseases were respectively 76.2, 94.4, 42.1 and 87.4%. Five samples (2.3%) gave doubtful reactions for BT. Prevalences of 28.5% for brucellosis, 14% for Rift Valley fever (RFV), 0.9% for Q fever and 11.2% for chlamydiosis were also recorded. Significantly higher values for BVD-MD (p<0.005), IBR-IPV (p<0.01) and brucellosis (p<0.05) were found in animals over 1 year of age. No differences were recorded between herds or between male and female animals. The high concentration of wild and domestic ruminants grazing together in the flood plains during the dry season may be a major determinant of the high values observed. Traditional farmers, slaughterhouse workers and other people involved in livestock production are particularly at risk of contracting brucellosis and RVF because of the high prevalences in cattle and local habits favourable to their transmission. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers bv.},

abstract={The conditioned infections due to opportunistic organisms, can be controlled by biological immunostimulators. The POLI-IF (Newcastle virus plus endotoxin of E. coli and Freund's incomplete adjuvant) rapidly induces the aspecific immunity. Given twice with 7-10 days interval in between, on occasion of a programmed stress (weaning, transport, crowding) it proved its efficacy in artificially suckled calves and in weaning piglets. The field trials, carried out on 2,782 treated calves in comparison with 2,909 untreated controls and on 4,387 piglets in comparison with 4,461 untreated controls, revealed statistically significant differences for P < 0.005 among the groups of treated and control animals. The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN. In our opinion the activity of the POLI-IF is bound to 3 factors at least: activation of the complementary fractions, mobilization of the immunocompetent cells, induction of IFN. © 1986.},

abstract={In this paper, the presence of visna-maedi in Italy, reported to exist since 1982 on clinical grounds, and the presence of anti-visna-maedi antibody is confirmed by the isolation of the viral agent from choroid plexus cells of an apparently healthy sheep. Gel diffusion test antigen, prepared from the explanted choroid plexus cells and from normal choroid plexus cells infected with the isolated agent, gave a positive reaction with one or two identity lines with reference antigens. The isolated agent gave both a characteristic cytopathic effect and a cytoplasmic fluorescence starting 24 hours after infection in normal choroid plexus cell cultures. Fluorescence was observed neither in control normal choroid plexus cells nor in infected normal choroid plexus cells incubated with a visna-maedi negative serum. By electron microscopy, budding forms arising from the cell membrane and extracellular particles of two distinct types were observed. One type was characterized by an electron-dense central core and a single membrane, and ranged from 80 to 110 nm, while the other had elongated bar-like cores and a double wall, and ranged from 100 to 140 nm. The characteristics observed for the isolated agent are identical to those reported by various authors for visna-maedi virus. © 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.},

abstract={An investigation carried out on 30 goat flocks in 7 Italian Regions showed the presence of antibodies against lentiviruses. The prevalence of serological positivity in the sample was 34.6%. The prevalence of infection in indigenous caprine breeds was markedly lower than that in animals of imported breeds (Sanaan, Toggenburg, Alpine). The prevalence was significantly higher in flocks with joint problems. On the basis of the serological examinations performed, joint problems do not seem to be ascribable to Mycoplasma or Chlamydia infection. The need to initiate prophylactic measures aiming at controlling lentivirus infection in Italian goat flocks, is emphasized. Untersuchungen über Lentivirusinfektionen in der italienischen Ziegenpopulation Eine Untersuchung über das Vorkommen von Antikörpern gegen Lentiviren bei 30 Ziegenherden in 7 italienischen Regionen verlief bei 34,6% der Tiere positiv. Die Infektionshäufigkeit war bei einheimischen Ziegenrassen deutlich niedriger als bei Tieren importierter Rassen (Sanaan, Toggenburg, Bergziegen). Bei Herden mit Gelenksentzündungen war die Häufigkeit signifikant höher. Auf Grund der serologischen Untersuchungen scheint es, daß Gelenkserkrankungen Infektionen mit Mykoplasmen oder Chlamydien nicht zugeschrieben werden können.

La fréquence de l'infection fut nettement plus basse chez les races caprines autochtones que chez les animaux des races importées (Sanaan, Toggenburg, chèvres de montagne). La fréquence fut significativement plus élevée dans les troupeaux présentant des inflammations articulaires. Il semble que sur la base des examens sérologiques, les infections articulaires n'ont pu être attribuées à des mycoplasmes ou à des chlamydias. La nécessité des mesures prophylactiques pour le contrôle des infections à Lentivirus dans les troupeaux de chèvres en Italie est relevée.

abstract={The presence of visna-maedi in Italy is reported for the first time. History, clinical findings and gross and microscopic lesions typical of the disease were observed in two sheep flocks in Central Italy. Affected animals were afebrile, lacked energy, lost condition and had progressively worsening dyspnoea which ended fatally. A few showed locomotor disturbances but remained alert. Anaemia and leukopenia were present. The lungs were affected with fleshy consolidation. Histologically, the pulmonary lesions included bronchiolar epithelial hyperplasia, peribronchiolar lymphoid cuffing, alveolar epithelialisation and very marked interstitial changes. In agar gel diffusion tests on sera from 106 animals from the two flocks, 44 were positive. Furthermore, when the same test was conducted as a preliminary screening procedure on 682 animals randomly chosen from 94 flocks in five Regions, 93 positive animals were revealed in 39 flocks, involving all of the Regions. The infection is likely to be widespread in Italy and to constitute a problem in at least some flocks or areas. © 1983 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The results of antibody titrations in different animal species vaccinated against rabies are reported. The following points are considered: (1) antibody titration may be used to detect an immunity status in dogs, (2) equines should be vaccinated in infected areas, (3) experiments in progress are comparing ERA vaccine and an inactivated vaccine in bovines, and (4) the vaccination of fallow deer (Dama dama) and moufflons (Ovis ammon musimon) produced results suggesting an extension of the experiment with the purpose of vaccinating wild ruminants whenever possible. © 1982.},

abstract={An epidemiological survey for dourine was carried out in 1975/6 in a zone of about 1,500 km. in the Abruzzi Region. The total equine population of the area, on the basis of official census data, was estimated to be about 3,000 head. Three blood samples collected from each of the 2,841 horses and 1,958 asses were examined for Trypanosoma equiperdum antibody by complement fixation (CF). The average prevalence rate in the whole population was 7.4%. Compared to the population average rate, a statistically higher rate was found in 6 municipalities, a lower rate in 1 municipality, and an average rate in 7 municipalities; 6 municipalities were found free of infection. Trypanosoma equiperdum antibody was found in 18.1% of the stallions, 6.8% of the mares, 6.6% of geldings, 4.5% of immature males, 5.4% of immature females, and 1.3% of she‐asses. The reactor rate in mares submitted to controlled stud stations was 8.1%, while in mares of uncontrolled studs it was 8.6%. In stallions from the authorized stud stations the reactor rate was 24.1%, in those used for unauthorized studs 16.7%. The prevalence rate was directly proportional to the population density of each of the 3 sub‐zones in which the entire territory was divided for geographical reasons. On the basis of the statistical analysis of the results, hypotheses are formulated on the mode of spread of the disease in the population. If the existing Regulations in Italy governing the authorization and periodical veterinary control of all stallions could be enforced the disease could probably be eradicated. Epidemiologie der Dourine innerhalb der Pferdepopulation der Abruzzen Die Dourine‐Epidemiologie wurde innerhalb einer 3000 Pferde umfassenden Region der Abruzzen (Fläche 1500 km2) untersucht. Von 2841 Pferden und 1958 Eseln wurden je drei Serumproben in der Komplementbindung auf Antikörper gegen Trypanosoma equiperdum untersucht. Das Mittel positiver Tiere der Gesamtpopulation lag bei 7,4%. In 6 Verwaltungsbezirken lag der Durchschnitt höher, in einem tiefer, 6 Bezirke erwiesen sich als negativ. Antikörper konnten bei 18,1% der untersuchten Hengste, 6,8% der Stuten, 6,6% der Wallache, 4,5% der Junghengste, 5,4% der Jungstuten und 1,3% der Eselinnen nachgewiesen werden. Stuten in kontrollierten Gestüten reagierten zu 8,1%, Hengste zu 24,1%. In unkontrollierten Betrieben betrugen die entsprechenden Werte 8,6% und 16,7%. Eine direkte Proportion bestand hinsichtlich Populationsdichte und Reagenten. Diese Ergebnisse sind die Grundlage einer Diskussion über die Epidemiologie der Dourine in der untersuchten Population. Kontrolle der Hengste könnte die Eradication der Krankheit ermöglichen. Epidémiologie de la dourine dans une population équine des Abruzzes L'épidémiologie de la dourine a étí examinée sur une population de 3000 chevaux dans une région des Abruzzes (surface 1500 km2). On a recherché par la méthode de fixation du complément des anticorps contre Trypanosoma equiperdum dans 3 échantillons de sérum de 2841 chevaux et 1958 ânes. La moyenne des animaux positifs de la population totale se situe vers 7,4%. La moyenne fut plus élevée dans 6 circonscriptions, plus basse dans une et 6 régions se sont révélées négatives. On a pu mettre en évidence des anticorps chez 18,1% des étalons examinées, 6,8% des juments, 6,6% des hongres, 4,5% des jeunes étalons, 5,4% des jeunes juments et 1,3% des ânesses. 8,1% des juments et 24,1% des étalons ont réagi dans des haras contrôlés. Ces valeurs furent de 8,6% et 16,7% dans des exploitations non contrôlées. Une proportion directe existe entre la densité de population et les animaux positifs. Ces résultats sont la base d'une discussion sur l'épidémiologie de la dourine dans la population examinée. Le contrôle des étalons devait rendre possible une éradication de la maladie. Epidemiología de la durina en la población equina de los Abruzos Se estudió la epidemiología de la durina dentro de la región italiana de los Abruzos (superficie 1.500 km.), la cual alberga unos 3.000 caballos. De 2.841 caballos y 1.958 burros se analizaron cada vez tres muestras séricas con la fijación del complemento en cuanto a la presencia de anticuerpos frente a Trypanosoma equiperdum. La media de animales positivos entre la población total era del orden del 7,4%. En 6 distritos administrativos se hallaba una media más elevada, en uno más baja, mientras que 6 se mostraron como negativos. Se pudieron identificar anticuerpos en el 18,1% de los caballos examinados, el 6,8% de las yeguas, el 6,6% de los espadones, el 4,5% de los machos jóvenes, el 5,4% de las yeguas jóvenes y el 1,3% de las burras. Las yeguas reaccionaban en las remontas controladas en un 8,1%, mientras que los machos en un 24,1%. En las explotaciones no controladas ascendían los valores correspondientes a 8,6% y 16,7%. Existía una proporción directa con respecto a la densidad de población y los reaccionantes. Estos resultados son el fundamento de una discusión sobre la epidemiología de la durina en la población examinada. El control de los caballos enteros podría hacer posible la erradicación de la enfermedad. © 1980 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

A beta‐haemolytic Streptococcus (type L) was isolated from a natural outbreak of a disease whose predominant symptoms were abortion and sterility in bitches. Experimental reproduction of the disease produced in bitches a type that was localized in the genital tract, as well as a more generalized syndrome; in the newborn puppies “fading” with death was seen. The authors conclude that canine Streptococcosis may be a specific disease involving both the genital tract and parenchymatous viscera. Promising results in the prevention of the disease by the use of chloramphenicol were obtained. Copyright © 1961, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},
